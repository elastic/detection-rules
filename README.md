# Detection Rules

Detection Rules is the home for rules used by Elastic Security. This repository is used for the development, maintenance, testing, validation, and release of rules for Elastic Security’s Detection Engine.

This repository was first announced on Elastic's blog post, [Elastic Security opens public detection rules repo](https://elastic.co/blog/elastic-security-opens-public-detection-rules-repo). For additional content, see the accompanying webinar, [Elastic Security: Introducing the public repository for detection rules](https://www.elastic.co/webinars/introducing-the-public-repository-for-detection-rules).

## Overview of this repository

Detection Rules contains more than just static rule files. This repository also contains code for unit testing in Python and integrating with the Detection Engine in Kibana.

## Getting started

Although rules can be added by manually creating `.toml` files, we don't recommend it. This repository also consists of a python module that aids rule creation and unit testing. Assuming you have Python 3.8+, run the below command to install the dependencies:
```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
