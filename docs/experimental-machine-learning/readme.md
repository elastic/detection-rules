# Experimental machine learning

This repo contains some additional information and files to use experimental[*](#what-does-experimental-mean-in-this-context) machine learning features and detections

## Features
* [DGA](DGA.md)
* [ProblemChild](problem_child.md)
* [experimental detections](experimental-detections.md)

## Releases

There are separate [releases](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/releases) for:
* DGA: `ML-DGA-*`
* problem child: `ML-ProblemChild-*`
* experimental detections: `ML-experimental-detections-*`

Releases will use the tag `ML-TYPE-YYYMMDD-N`, which will be needed for uploading the model using the CLI.


## CLI

Support commands can be found under `python -m detection_rules es <es args> experimental ml -h`

```console
Elasticsearch client:
Options:
  -et, --timeout INTEGER    Timeout for elasticsearch client
  -ep, --es-password TEXT
  -eu, --es-user TEXT
  --elasticsearch-url TEXT
  --cloud-id TEXT


* experimental commands are use at your own risk and may change without warning *

Usage: detection_rules es experimental ml [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Experimental machine learning commands.

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  check-files               Check ML model files on an elasticsearch...
  delete-job                Remove experimental ML jobs.
  remove-model              Remove ML model files.
  remove-scripts-pipelines  Remove ML scripts and pipeline files.
  setup                     Upload ML model and dependencies to enrich data.
  upload-job                Upload experimental ML jobs.
```

## Managing a model and dependencies using the CLI

### Installing

```console
python -m detection_rules es experimental ml setup -h

Elasticsearch client:
Options:
  -et, --timeout INTEGER    Timeout for elasticsearch client
  -ep, --es-password TEXT
  -eu, --es-user TEXT
  --cloud-id TEXT
  --elasticsearch-url TEXT


* experimental commands are use at your own risk and may change without warning *

Usage: detection_rules es experimental ml setup [OPTIONS]

  Upload ML model and dependencies to enrich data.

Options:
  -t, --model-tag TEXT       Release tag for model files staged in detection-
                             rules (required to download files)
  -r, --repo TEXT            GitHub repository hosting the model file releases
                             (owner/repo)
  -d, --model-dir DIRECTORY  Directory containing local model files
  --overwrite                Overwrite all files if already in the stack
  -h, --help                 Show this message and exit.

```

### Removing

To remove the ML bundle, you will need to remove the pipelines and scripts first and then the model.

You can do this by running:
* `python -m detection_rules es experimental ml remove-pipeline-scripts --dga --problemchild`
* `python -m detection_rules es experimental ml remove-model <model-id>`

##### What does experimental mean in this context?

Experimental model bundles (models, scripts, and pipelines), rules, and jobs are components which are currently in 
development and so may not have completed the testing or scrutiny which full production detections are subjected to.

It may also make use of features which are not yet GA and so may be subject to change and are not covered by the support 
SLA of general release (GA) features. Some of these features may also never make it to GA.
