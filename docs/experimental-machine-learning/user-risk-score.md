# User Risk Score

The User Risk Score feature highlights risky usernames from within your environment. It utilizes a transform with a scripted metric aggregation to calculate user risk scores based on alerts that were generated within the past three months. The transform runs hourly to update the score as new alerts are generated. Each alert's contribution to the user risk score is based on the alert's risk score (`signal.rule.risk_score`). The risk score is calculated using a weighted sum where rules with higher time-corrected risk scores also have higher weights. Each risk score is normalized to a scale of 0 to 100.

User Risk Score is an experimental feature that assigns risk scores to usernames in a given Kibana space. Risk scores are calculated for each username by utilizing transforms on the alerting indices. The transform updates the score as new alerts are generated. The User Risk Score [package](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/releases/tag/ML-UserRiskScore-20220628-1) contains all of the required artifacts for setup. The User Risk Score feature provides Lens dashboards for viewing summary and detailed username risk score information. The detail view dashboard - Drilldown of User Risk Score - presents detail on why a username has been given a high risk score. In addition, user risk scores are presented in the detailed view for a username in the Elastic Security App.


### On Usernames and Risk Scores

 Many alerts contain usernames which were present in the original log or event documents that alert rules, or anomaly rules, matched. These are discrete usernames, not (yet) pointers to a user *entity*. In most environments, each human user has multiple usernames across the various applications and systems they use. In order to investigate a user, it may be necessary to add each of their usernames to the list of usernames being used to filter the output of the detail dashboard.

In some cases, there are certain usernames that are not readily individuated. The Local System, or SYSTEM account, under Windows, for example, has the same name and the same SID (security identifier) on every Windows host. In order to individuate a particular Local System user account, it is necessary to add its hostname as a filter. The user risk score detail dashboard contains tables of alerts by hostname, in addition to username, in order to help identify the hostname(s) associated with a local user that has been given a risk score.

<h3 id="modify-artifacts">1. Obtain artifacts</h3>

The User Risk Score functionality is space aware for privacy. Downloaded artifacts must be modified with the desired space before they can be used.

 - Download the release bundle from [here](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/releases/tag/ML-UserRiskScore-20220628-1). The User Risk Score releases can be identified by the tag `ML-UserRiskScore-YYYYMMDD-N`. Check the release description to make sure it is compatible with the Elastic Stack version you are running.
 - Unzip the contents of `ML-UserRiskScore-YYYYMMDD-N.zip`.
 - Run `ml_userriskscore_generate_scripts.py` script in the unzipped directory with your Kibana space as the argument.
<div style="margin-left: 40px">   
<i>Example of modifying artifacts for the default space</i>
   <pre style="margin-top:-2px"><code>python ml_userriskscore_generate_scripts.py --space default

<h3 id="enable-kibana">8. Enable Kibana features</h3>

To enable the Kibana features for User Risk Score, you will first need to add the following configuration to `kibana.yml`.

```
xpack.securitySolution.enableExperimental: ['riskyUsersEnabled']
```
This can be added by editing the kibana.yml file, on a Kibana server instance, or by modifying a Kibana server configuration, in an Elastic Cloud deployment, using the steps documented here:

https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-enterprise/current/ece-manage-kibana-settings.html

Once you have modified the `kibana.yml` file, you will find User Risk Scoring features in the "User Risk" tab in the detail view for a username. The detail view is reached by clicking a username in the Users page in the Security Solution:
