- `v8.13`
- `v8.12`

### Previous Versions Maintained

The following version(s) are maintained along with the current version.

- `v8.11`
- `v8.10`

## End of Life Policy

Our policy is to support and provide public releases for `Current`, `Current-1`, `Current-2`, `Current-3` versions. We maintain and do not release `Current-4` and `Current-5` versions.


# Code Supported Versions and Releases

This outlines the versioning strategy and release process for the [detection-rules](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules) repository, covering the core code, `kql` and `kibana` libraries, configuration files, and the `hunting` folder. The strategy follows semantic versioning to ensure clear communication of changes to users and compatibility with different Elastic Stack versions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This versioning process **excludes** the detection rules themselves. Detection rules are released separately and are not tied to the following process.

---

## Versioning Strategy

### Components Covered by Versioning:
- **Core Detection-Rules Code**: Handles logic for rule management, CLI, etc.
- **Libraries**:
  - **`kql`**: Manages Kibana Query Language parsing and operations.
  - **`kibana`**: Handles integrations and API interactions with Kibana.
- **Configuration Files**: Under the `etc/` folder that impact schema and DAC.
- **Hunting Logic**: The `hunting/` folder, which manages hunting rules.


### Semantic Versioning Approach:
We will use **Semantic Versioning** with the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:
- **MAJOR version (`X.0.0`)**: For backward-incompatible changes.
- **MINOR version (`0.Y.0`)**: For backward-compatible new features.
- **PATCH version (`0.0.Z`)**: For backward-compatible bug fixes or small improvements.

> [!NOTE]
> The GitHub labels `patch`, `minor`, or `major` will be used in PRs to indicate the type of change being made.

## Versioning Guidelines

### Patch Version (`0.0.Z`):
Increment the patch version when making bug fixes, performance improvements, or small enhancements that do not break backward compatibility. Open a PR to ensure the proper `pyproject.toml` files and any other `version` related files are bumped.

<details><summary>Expand for Examples</summary>
<p>

**Examples**:
- **Kibana Library**:
  - Minor fixes to API calls to ensure correct data retrieval.
  - Updates to the `kibana` lib without adding new features.
- **KQL Library**:
  - Small bug fixes in the query parsing logic.
  - Optimizations that don't alter functionality.
- **Core Detection-Rules Code**:
  - Fixes for CLI bugs or performance tweaks.
  - Minor enhancements to rule management that donâ€™t require users to change workflows.
- **Hunting Folder**:
  - Bug fixes in hunting rules logic.
  - Small performance tweaks for the hunting rule management.
- **Docs Folder**:
  - Updates to documentation.

</p>
</details>

### Minor Version (`0.Y.0`):
Increment the minor version when adding backward-compatible new features, enhancements, or functionality.

<details><summary>Expand for Examples</summary>
<p>

**Examples**:
- **Kibana Library**:
  - Adding a new API endpoint to interact with Elastic Kibana X.Y while maintaining backward compatibility with older versions.
- **KQL Library**:
  - Adding new query parsing functionality that is backward-compatible with previous Elastic Stack versions.
- **Core Detection-Rules Code**:
  - New CLI commands or functionality for managing detection rules.
  - New optional fields in rule schemas that have minimum compatibility requirements. (e.g adding `alert_suppression` with `min_compat=8.14`).
- **Hunting Folder**:
  - Adding new hunting rule management features that are optional and backward-compatible.
  - Enhancements in generating hunting rule markdown or CLI features.

</p>
</details>

> [!NOTE]
> When bumping this version, the patch version should be reset to `0` and the major version should remain the same.

---

### Major Version (`X.0.0`):
Increment the major version when introducing backward-incompatible changes that require users to update workflows, Elastic Stack versions, or rule management strategies.

<details><summary>Expand for Examples</summary>
<p>

**Examples**:
- **Kibana Library**:
  - Replacing or removing an existing API endpoint that forces users to upgrade to Elastic X.Y
- **KQL Library**:
  - Structural changes to query parsing logic that break compatibility with previous Elastic Stack versions.
- **Core Detection-Rules Code**:
  - Breaking changes to rule schema definitions or CLI workflows that require user updates.
  - Forcing users to migrate to a newer Elastic Stack version due to changes in core code or schema compatibility.
- **Hunting Folder**:
  - Major refactors of the hunting logic that break existing workflows.
  - Changes to how hunting rules are defined or managed, requiring users to adjust configurations.

</p>

> [!NOTE]
> When bumping this version, the minor version and patch version should be reset to `0`.

## Tagging Process

Each release will be tagged using the following format:
- **Tag Format**: `dev-vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `dev-v1.2.0`).
- **Single Tag for Combined Releases**: If there are changes to the core detection-rules code or libraries (`kql`, `kibana`), they will be tagged together as a single release with the core detection-rules versioning.
- **Hunting Folder**: Changes to the hunting logic will be included in the combined release.

> [!CAUTION]
> When a version is bumped in a lib, we need to also bump the core `pyproject.toml` file *(e.g A version bump in `kql` will also require a similar version bump in the core detection-rules versioning)*.
---

## When to Trigger a GitHub Release

A draft release will be triggered in the following cases:
- **New Feature or Bug Fix**: Once a feature or bug fix is merged into `main`, a version bump is made according to the semantic versioning rules.
- **Version Bump**: After the version bump, a GitHub release will be created using **release-drafter** CI workflow to automate draft release generation.

As pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish quarterly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Proper PR labels need to be added for this to properly be labeled and added to the draft.
