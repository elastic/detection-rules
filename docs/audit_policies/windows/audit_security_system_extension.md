## Setup

Some detection rules require monitoring security system extensions to detect unauthorized modifications, such as the installation of new system services, drivers, or security-related components. Enabling this setting helps ensure visibility into critical system changes that could impact security and system integrity.

### Enable Audit Policy via Group Policy

To enable `Audit Security System Extension` across a group of servers using Active Directory Group Policies, administrators must enable the `Audit Security System Extension` policy. Follow these steps to configure the audit policy via Advanced Audit Policy Configuration:

```
Computer Configuration >
Policies >
Windows Settings >
Security Settings >
Advanced Audit Policies Configuration >
Audit Policies >
System >
**Audit Security System Extension (Success)**
```

### Enable Locally using auditpol

To enable this policy on a local machine, run the following command in an elevated command prompt:

```
auditpol.exe /set /subcategory:"Security System Extension" /success:enable /failure:enable
```
