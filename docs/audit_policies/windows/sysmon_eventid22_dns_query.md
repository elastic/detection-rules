## Setup

**Caution:** Collecting Sysmon events without a tailored configuration for your environment will cause high data volume. These setup instructions would need significant tuning in order to be production-ready. For more specific configurations, we recommend you to explore the following resources:

 - https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular
 - https://github.com/Neo23x0/sysmon-config

Some detection rules require the use of Sysmon Event ID 22 (DNS Query) events to detect malicious activity, such as command and control (C2) communications, DNS tunneling, or connections to malicious domains.

To collect these logs, use the [Windows Integration](https://www.elastic.co/docs/current/integrations/windows) and select the `Sysmon Operational` channel on the integration setup page.

## Configuration Example

The following snippet demonstrates the minimal configuration required to enable Event ID 22 (DNS Query). While this will turn on the event logging, it lacks the necessary filtering for a production environment and will generate significant noise. It should be used as a reference and integrated into a more robust configuration, such as those provided in the resources above.

```xml
<Sysmon schemaversion="4.90">
    <HashAlgorithms>md5,sha256</HashAlgorithms>
    <EventFiltering>
        <!-- Log all DNS query events -->
        <DnsQuery onmatch="exclude"></DnsQuery>
    </EventFiltering>
</Sysmon>
```
