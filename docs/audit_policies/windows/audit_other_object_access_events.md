## Setup

Some detection rules require monitoring other object access events to detect unauthorized actions or system modifications. Enabling this setting allows you to monitor operations with scheduled tasks, COM+ objects and indirect object access requests.

### Enable Audit Policy via Group Policy

To enable `Audit Other Object Access Events` across a group of servers using Active Directory Group Policies, administrators must enable the `Audit Other Object Access Events` policy. Follow these steps to configure the audit policy via Advanced Audit Policy Configuration:

```
Computer Configuration >
Windows Settings >
Security Settings >
Advanced Audit Policy Configuration >
Audit Policies >
Object Access >
**Audit Other Object Access Events (Success,Failure)**
```

### Enable Locally using auditpol

To enable this policy on a local machine, run the following command in an elevated command prompt:

```
auditpol.exe /set /subcategory:"Other Object Access Events" /success:enable /failure:enable
```

## Event IDs

When this audit policy is enabled, the following event IDs may be generated:

* **4671**: An application attempted to access a blocked ordinal through the TBS.
* **4691**: Indirect access to an object was requested.
* **4698**: A scheduled task was created.
