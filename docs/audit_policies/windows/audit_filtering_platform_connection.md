## Setup

Some detection rules require monitoring network connections managed by the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) to detect unauthorized or suspicious network activity.

**Caution:** Enabling this audit policy can generate a high volume of events. Evaluate the audit policy in a group of servers to measure volume and filter unwanted events before deploying in the entire domain.

### Enable Audit Policy via Group Policy

To enable `Audit Filtering Platform Connection` across a group of servers using Active Directory Group Policies, administrators must enable the `Audit Filtering Platform Connection` policy. Follow these steps to configure the audit policy via Advanced Audit Policy Configuration:

```
Computer Configuration >
Windows Settings >
Security Settings >
Advanced Security Audit Policy Settings >
Audit Policies >
Object Access >
Audit Filtering Platform Connection (Success,Failure)
```

### Enable Locally using auditpol

To enable this policy on a local machine, run the following command in an elevated command prompt:

```
auditpol.exe /set /subcategory:"Filtering Platform Connection" /success:enable /failure:enable
```

## Event IDs

When this audit policy is enabled, the following event IDs may be generated:

* **5031**: The Windows Firewall Service blocked an application from accepting incoming connections on the network.
* **5150**: The Windows Filtering Platform blocked a packet.
* **5151**: A more restrictive Windows Filtering Platform filter has blocked a packet.
* **5154**: The Windows Filtering Platform has permitted an application or service to listen on a port for incoming connections.
* **5155**: The Windows Filtering Platform has blocked an application or service from listening on a port for incoming connections.
* **5156**: The Windows Filtering Platform has permitted a connection.
* **5157**: The Windows Filtering Platform has blocked a connection.
* **5158**: The Windows Filtering Platform has permitted a bind to a local port.
