# Sysmon Event ID 12, 13, 14: Registry Events

## Setup

**Caution:** Collecting Sysmon events without a tailored configuration for your environment will cause high data volume. These setup instructions would need significant tuning in order to be production-ready. For more specific configurations, we recommend you to explore the following resources:
 - https://github.com/trustedsec/SysmonCommunityGuide
 - https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular
 - https://github.com/Neo23x0/sysmon-config

Some detection rules require the use of Sysmon registry events (Event IDs 12, 13, and 14) to detect malicious activity, such as attackers establishing persistence via Registry Run keys, disabling security services, or tampering with system configurations.

To collect these logs, use the [Windows Integration](https://www.elastic.co/docs/current/integrations/windows) and select the `Sysmon Operational` channel on the integration setup page.

## Configuration Example

The following snippet demonstrates the minimal configuration required to enable Sysmon's registry monitoring capabilities. This single configuration block enables Event ID 12 (Registry Object Create and Delete), Event ID 13 (Registry Value Set), and Event ID 14 (Registry Object Renamed). While this will turn on the event logging, it lacks the necessary filtering for a production environment and will generate significant noise. It should be used as a reference and integrated into a more robust configuration, such as those provided in the resources above.

```xml
<Sysmon schemaversion="4.90">
    <HashAlgorithms>md5,sha256</HashAlgorithms>
    <EventFiltering>
        <!-- Log all registry events (Covers IDs 12, 13, and 14) -->
        <RegistryEvent onmatch="exclude"></RegistryEvent>
    </EventFiltering>
</Sysmon>
```
