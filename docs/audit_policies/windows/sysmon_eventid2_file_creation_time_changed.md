## Setup

**Caution:** Collecting Sysmon events without a tailored configuration for your environment will cause high data volume. These setup instructions would need significant tuning in order to be production-ready. For more specific configurations, we recommend you to explore the following resources:

 - https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular
 - https://github.com/Neo23x0/sysmon-config

Some detection rules require the use of Sysmon Event ID 2 (File Creation Time Changed) events to detect timestomping activity, a technique often used by adversaries to hide their tracks.

To collect these logs, use the [Windows Integration](https://www.elastic.co/docs/current/integrations/windows) and select the `Sysmon Operational` channel on the integration setup page.

## Configuration Example

The following snippet demonstrates the minimal configuration required to enable Event ID 2 (File Creation Time Changed). While this will turn on the event logging, it lacks the necessary filtering for a production environment and will generate significant noise. It should be used as a reference and integrated into a more robust configuration, such as those provided in the resources above.

```xml
<Sysmon schemaversion="4.90">
    <HashAlgorithms>md5,sha256</HashAlgorithms>
    <EventFiltering>
        <!-- Log all file creation time change events -->
        <FileCreateTime onmatch="exclude"></FileCreateTime>
    </EventFiltering>
</Sysmon>
```
