# To turn on automatic schema generation for non-ecs fields via custom schemas use a line like the following.
# This will generate a schema file in the specified location that will be used to add entries for each field
# and index combination that is not already in a known schema. This will also automatically add it to your
# stack-schema-map.yaml file when using a custom rules directory and config.
# auto_gen_schema_file: "etc/auto-gen-schema.json"

# To on bulk disable elastic validation for optional fields, use the following line
# bypass_optional_elastic_validation: True

# This points to the testing config file (see example under detection_rules/etc/example_test_config.yaml)
# This can either be set here or as the environment variable `DETECTION_RULES_TEST_CONFIG`, with precedence
#   going to the environment variable if both are set. Having both these options allows for configuring testing on
#   prebuilt Elastic rules without specifying a rules _config.yaml.
#
# If set in this file, the path should be relative to the location of this config. If passed as an environment variable,
#    it should be the full path
# Note: Using the `custom-rules setup-config <name>` command will generate a config called `test_config.yaml`

# To prevent the tactic prefix from being added to the rule filename, set the line below to True
# This config line can be used instead of specifying the `--no-tactic-filename` flag in the CLI
# Mind that for unit tests, you also want to disable the filename test in the test_config.yaml
# no_tactic_filename: True
