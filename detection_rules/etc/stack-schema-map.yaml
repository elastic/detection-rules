# Purpose: Alignment of stack with beats and ecs versions

# Notes
## ECS versions do not align perfectly with stack releases (as of 7.13), so this will reflect MAX ecs version for a given release
## To determine beats versions, visit https://github.com/elastic/beats/tags to determine latest version during preparation PR

## Updates:
## 7.17 was intentionally skipped because it was added late and was bug fix only
## 06/2022 - dropped backport support for 7.13.0, 7.14.0, 7.15.0 as of 8.4 branch creation
## 01/2023 - dropped backport support for 7.16.0, 8.0.0, 8.1.0, 8.2.0 - https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/pull/2450
