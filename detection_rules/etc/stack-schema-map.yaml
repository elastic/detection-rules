# Purpose: Alignment of stack with beats and ecs versions

# Notes
## ECS versions do not align perfectly with stack releases (as of 7.13), so this will reflect MAX ecs version for a given release
## To determine beats versions, visit https://github.com/elastic/beats/tags to determine latest version during preparation PR

## Updates:
## 7.17 was intentionally skipped because it was added late and was bug fix only
## 06/2022 - dropped backport support for 7.13.0, 7.14.0, 7.15.0 as of 8.4 branch creation

## Unsupported
#"7.13.0":
#  # beats release about the same time as the stack, so we cannot update this until it is released
#  beats: "7.13.2"
#  ecs: "1.9.0"

#"7.14.0":
#  beats: "7.14.0"
#  ecs: "1.10.0"
