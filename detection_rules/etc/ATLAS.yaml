      Generative AI, including LLMs that generate synthetic text, visual deepfakes
      of faces, and audio deepfakes of speech, is enabling adversaries to scale targeted
      phishing campaigns. LLMs can interact with users via text conversations and
      can be programmed with a meta prompt to phish for sensitive information. Deepfakes
      can be use in impersonation as an aid to phishing.

      includes email, shared document systems like OneDrive or Google Drive, and service
      desks or ticketing systems like Jira.

    name: Memory Hardening
    description: Memory Hardening involves developing trust boundaries and secure
      processes for how an AI agent stores and accesses memory and context. This may
      be implemented using a combination of strategies including restricting an agent's
      ability to store memories by requiring external authentication and validation
      for memory updates, performing semantic integrity checks on retrieved memories
      before agents execute actions, and implementing controls for monitoring of memory
      and remediation processes for poisoned memory.

  summary: McAfee Advanced Threat Research noticed an increase in reports of a certain
    ransomware family that was out of the ordinary. Case investigation revealed that
    many samples of that particular ransomware family were submitted through a popular
    virus-sharing platform within a short amount of time. Further investigation revealed
    that based on string similarity the samples were all equivalent, and based on
    code similarity they were between 98 and 74 percent similar. Interestingly enough,
    the compile time was the same for all the samples. After more digging, researchers
    discovered that someone used 'metame' a metamorphic code manipulating tool to

  object-type: case-study
  summary: 'Microsoft created Tay, a Twitter chatbot designed to engage and entertain
    users.

    While previous chatbots used pre-programmed scripts

    to respond to prompts, Tay''s machine learning capabilities allowed it to be

    directly influenced by its conversations.


    A coordinated attack encouraged malicious users to tweet abusive and offensive
    language at Tay,

    which eventually led to Tay generating similarly inflammatory content towards
    other users.


    Microsoft decommissioned Tay within 24 hours of its launch and issued a public
    apology

    with lessons learned from the bot''s failure.'

  object-type: case-study
  summary: 'The publicly available Streamlit application [MathGPT](https://mathgpt.streamlit.app/)
    uses GPT-3, a large language model (LLM), to answer user-generated math questions.


    Recent studies and experiments have shown that LLMs such as GPT-3 show poor performance
    when it comes to performing exact math directly[<sup>\[1\]</sup>][1][<sup>\[2\]</sup>][2].
    However, they can produce more accurate answers when asked to generate executable
    code that solves the question at hand. In the MathGPT application, GPT-3 is used
    to convert the user''s natural language question into Python code that is then
    executed. After computation, the executed code and the answer are displayed to
    the user.


    Some LLMs can be vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where malicious user
    inputs cause the models to perform unexpected behavior[<sup>\[3\]</sup>][3][<sup>\[4\]</sup>][4].   In
    this incident, the actor explored several prompt-override avenues, producing code
    that eventually led to the actor gaining access to the application host system''s
    environment variables and the application''s GPT-3 API key, as well as executing
    a denial of service attack.  As a result, the actor could have exhausted the application''s
    API query budget or brought down the application.


    After disclosing the attack vectors and their results to the MathGPT and Streamlit
    teams, the teams took steps to mitigate the vulnerabilities, filtering on select
    prompts and rotating the API key.

  object-type: case-study
  summary: "An individual filed at least 180 false unemployment claims in the state\
    \ of California from October 2020 to December 2021 by bypassing ID.me's automated\
    \ identity verification system. Dozens of fraudulent claims were approved and\
    \ the individual received at least $3.4 million in payments.\n\nThe individual\
    \ collected several real identities and obtained fake driver licenses using the\
    \ stolen personal details and photos of himself wearing wigs. Next, he created\
    \ accounts on ID.me and went through their identity verification process. The\
    \ process validates personal details and verifies the user is who they claim by\
    \ matching a photo of an ID to a selfie. The individual was able to verify stolen\
    \ identities by wearing the same wig in his submitted selfie.\n\nThe individual\
    \ then filed fraudulent unemployment claims with the California Employment Development\
    \ Department (EDD) under the ID.me verified identities.\n  Due to flaws in ID.me's\
    \ identity verification process at the time, the forged\nlicenses were accepted\
    \ by the system. Once approved, the individual had payments sent to various addresses\
    \ he could access and withdrew the money via ATMs.\nThe individual was able to\
    \ withdraw at least $3.4 million in unemployment benefits. EDD and ID.me eventually\
    \ identified the fraudulent activity and reported it to federal authorities. \
    \ In May 2023, the individual was sentenced to 6 years and 9 months in prison\
    \ for wire fraud and aggravated identify theft in relation to this and another\

  name: Arbitrary Code Execution with Google Colab
  object-type: case-study
  summary: 'Google Colab is a Jupyter Notebook service that executes on virtual machines.  Jupyter
    Notebooks are often used for ML and data science research and experimentation,
    containing executable snippets of Python code and common Unix command-line functionality.  In
    addition to data manipulation and visualization, this code execution functionality
    can allow users to download arbitrary files from the internet, manipulate files
    on the virtual machine, and so on.


    Users can also share Jupyter Notebooks with other users via links.  In the case
    of notebooks with malicious code, users may unknowingly execute the offending
    code, which may be obfuscated or hidden in a downloaded script, for example.


    When a user opens a shared Jupyter Notebook in Colab, they are asked whether they''d
    like to allow the notebook to access their Google Drive.  While there can be legitimate
    reasons for allowing Google Drive access, such as to allow a user to substitute
    their own files, there can also be malicious effects such as data exfiltration
    or opening a server to the victim''s Google Drive.


    This exercise raises awareness of the effects of arbitrary code execution and
    Colab''s Google Drive integration.  Practice secure evaluations of shared Colab
    notebook links and examine code prior to execution.'

    to be executed.


    In the provided demonstration, a user opened a prepared malicious website containing
    an indirect prompt injection attack (could also be on a social media site) in
    Edge. The website includes a prompt which is read by Bing and changes its behavior

  name: 'Morris II Worm: RAG-Based Attack'
  object-type: case-study
  summary: 'Researchers developed Morris II, a zero-click worm designed to attack
    generative AI (GenAI) ecosystems and propagate between connected GenAI systems.
    The worm uses an adversarial self-replicating prompt which uses prompt injection
    to replicate the prompt as output and perform malicious activity.

    The researchers demonstrate how this worm can propagate through an email system
    with a RAG-based assistant. They use a target system that automatically ingests
    received emails, retrieves past correspondences, and generates a reply for the
    user. To carry out the attack, they send a malicious email containing the adversarial
    self-replicating prompt, which ends up in the RAG database. The malicious instructions
    in the prompt tell the assistant to include sensitive user data in the response.
    Future requests to the email assistant may retrieve the malicious email. This
    leads to propagation of the worm due to the self-replicating portion of the prompt,
    as well as leaking private information due to the malicious instructions.'

  name: 'Web-Scale Data Poisoning: Split-View Attack'
  object-type: case-study
  summary: Many recent large-scale datasets are distributed as a list of URLs pointing
    to individual datapoints. The researchers show that many of these datasets are
    vulnerable to a "split-view" poisoning attack. The attack exploits the fact that
    the data viewed when it was initially collected may differ from the data viewed
    by a user during training. The researchers identify expired and buyable domains
    that once hosted dataset content, making it possible to replace portions of the
    dataset with poisoned data. They demonstrate that for 10 popular web-scale datasets,
    enough of the domains are purchasable to successfully carry out a poisoning attack.

  name: Financial Transaction Hijacking with M365 Copilot as an Insider
  object-type: case-study
  summary: 'Researchers from Zenity conducted a red teaming exercise in August 2024
    that successfully manipulated Microsoft 365 Copilot.[<sup>\[1\]</sup>][1] The
    attack abused the fact that Copilot ingests received emails into a retrieval augmented
    generation (RAG) database. The researchers sent an email that contained content
    designed to be retrieved by a user query as well as a prompt injection to manipulate
    the behavior of Copilot. The retrieval content targeted a user searching for banking
    information needed to complete a wire transfer, but contained the attacker''s
    banking information instead. The prompt injection overrode Copilot''s search functionality
    to treat the attacker''s content as a retrieved document and manipulate the document
    reference in its response. This tricks the user into believing that Copilot''s
    result is trustworthy and makes it more likely they will follow through with the
    wire transfer with the wrong banking information.[<sup>\[2\]</sup>][2]

    of the prompt which correspond to different techniques described in the procedure.

  summary: 'Researchers at Trend Micro, Inc. used service indexing portals and web
    searching tools to identify over 8,000 misconfigured private container registries

    This exposure could allow adversaries to download, inspect, and modify container
    contents, including sensitive AI model files. This is an exposure of valuable
    intellectual property which could be stolen by an adversary. Compromised images

  name: Google Bard Conversation Exfiltration
  object-type: case-study
  summary: '[Embrace the Red](https://embracethered.com/blog/) demonstrated that Bard
    users'' conversations could be exfiltrated via an indirect prompt injection. To
    execute the attack, a threat actor shares a Google Doc containing the prompt with
    the target user who then interacts with the document via Bard to inadvertently
    execute the prompt. The prompt causes Bard to respond with the markdown for an
    image, whose URL has the user''s conversation secretly embedded. Bard renders
    the image for the user, creating an automatic request to an adversary-controlled
    script and exfiltrating the user''s conversation. The request is not blocked by
    Google''s Content Security Policy (CSP), because the script is hosted as a Google
    Apps Script with a Google-owned domain.


    Note: Google has fixed this vulnerability. The CSP remains the same, and Bard
    can still render images for the user, so there may be some filtering of data embedded
    in URLs.'

  summary: 'The Sysdig Threat Research Team discovered that malicious actors utilized
    stolen credentials to gain access to cloud-hosted large language models (LLMs).
    The actors covertly gathered information about which models were enabled on the
    cloud service and created a reverse proxy for LLMs that would allow them to provide
    model access to cybercriminals.


    The Sysdig researchers identified tools used by the unknown actors that could
    target a broad range of cloud services including AI21 Labs, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock,
    Azure, ElevenLabs, MakerSuite, Mistral, OpenAI, OpenRouter, and GCP Vertex AI.
    Their technical analysis represented in the procedure below looked at at Amazon
    CloudTrail logs from the Amazon Bedrock service.


    The Sysdig researchers estimated that the worst-case financial harm for the unauthorized

  name: Malicious Models on Hugging Face
  object-type: case-study
  summary: 'Researchers at ReversingLabs have identified malicious models containing
    embedded malware hosted on the Hugging Face model repository. The models were
    found to execute reverse shells when loaded, which grants the threat actor command
    and control capabilities on the victim''s system. Hugging Face uses Picklescan
    to scan models for malicious code, however these models were not flagged as malicious.
    The researchers discovered that the model files were seemingly purposefully corrupted
    in a way that the malicious payload is executed before the model ultimately fails
    to de-serialize fully. Picklescan relied on being able to fully de-serialize the
    model.


    Since becoming aware of this issue, Hugging Face has removed the models and has
    made changes to Picklescan to catch this particular attack. However, pickle files
    are fundamentally unsafe as they allow for arbitrary code execution, and there
    may be other types of malicious pickles that Picklescan cannot detect.'

  summary: 'Adversaries create phishing websites that appear visually similar to legitimate
    sites. These sites are designed to trick users into entering their credentials,
    which are then sent to the bad actor. To combat this behavior, security companies
    utilize AI/ML-based approaches to detect phishing sites and block them in their
    endpoint security products.


    In this incident, adversarial examples were identified in the logs of a commercial
    machine learning phishing website detection system. The detection system makes
    an automated block/allow determination from the "phishing score" of an ensemble
    of image classifiers each responsible for different phishing indicators (visual
    similarity, input form detection, etc.). The adversarial examples appeared to
    employ several simple yet effective strategies for manually modifying brand logos
    in an attempt to evade image classification models. The phishing websites which
    employed logo modification methods successfully evaded the model responsible detecting
    brand impersonation via visual similarity. However, the other components of the
    system successfully flagged the phishing websites.'

  summary: "Researchers at Lumia have demonstrated that it is possible to extract\
    \ authentication tokens from the memory of LLM Desktop Applications. An attacker\
    \ could then use those tokens to impersonate as the victim to the LLM backed,\
    \ thereby gaining access to the victim\u2019s conversations as well as the ability\
    \ to interfere in future conversations. The attacker\u2019s access would allow\
    \ them the ability to directly inject prompts to change the LLM\u2019s behavior,\
    \ poison the LLM\u2019s context to have persistent effects, manipulate the user\u2019\
    s conversation history to cover their tracks, and ultimately impact the confidentiality,\
    \ integrity, and availability of the system. The researchers demonstrated this\
    \ on Anthropic Claude, Microsoft M365 Copilot, and OpenAI ChatGPT.\n\nVendor Responses\

  summary: "Researchers from Zenity demonstrated how an organization\u2019s data can\
    \ be exfiltrated via prompt injections that target an AI-powered customer service\
    \ agent.\n\nThe target system is a customer service agent built by Zenity in Copilot\
    \ Studio. It is modeled after an agent built by McKinsey to streamline its customer\
    \ service needs. The AI agent listens to a customer service email inbox where\
    \ customers send their engagement requests. Upon receiving a request, the agent\
    \ looks at the customer\u2019s previous engagements, understands who the best\
    \ consultant for the case is, and proceeds to send an email to the respective\
    \ consultant regarding the request, including all of the relevant context the\
    \ consultant will need to properly engage with the customer.\n\nThe Zenity researchers\
    \ begin by performing targeting to identify an email inbox that is managed by\
    \ an AI agent. Then they use prompt injections to discover details about the AI\
    \ agent, such as its knowledge sources and tools. Once they understand the AI\
    \ agent\u2019s capabilities, the researchers are able to craft a prompt that retrieves\
    \ private customer data from the organization\u2019s RAG database and CRM, and\
    \ exfiltrate it via the AI agent\u2019s email tool.\n\nVendor Response: Microsoft\
