Identifies Microsoft Entra ID Protection sign-in risk detections triggered by a range of risk events such as anonymized
IP addresses, password spray attacks, impossible travel, token anomalies, and more. These detections are often early
indicators of potential account compromise or malicious sign-in behavior. This is a promotion rule intended to surface
all Entra ID sign-in risk events for further investigation and correlation with other identity-related activity. This is
a building block rule that is used to collect all Microsoft Entra ID Protection sign-in or user risk detections. It is
not intended to be used as a standalone detection.
