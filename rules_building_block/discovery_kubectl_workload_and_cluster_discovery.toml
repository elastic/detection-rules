This rule detects the execution of kubectl commands that are commonly used for workload and cluster
discovery in Kubernetes environments. It looks for process events where kubectl is executed with
arguments that query cluster information, such as namespaces, nodes, pods, deployments, and other
resources. In environments where kubectl is not expected to be used, this could indicate potential
reconnaissance activity by an adversary.
