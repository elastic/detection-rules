Identifies the access on an object with WRITEDAC permissions. With the WRITEDAC permission, the user can perform a Write
Discretionary Access Control List (WriteDACL) operation, which is used to modify the access control rules associated
with a specific object within Active Directory. Attackers may abuse this privilege to grant themselves or other
compromised accounts additional rights, ultimately compromising the target object, resulting in privilege escalation,
lateral movement, and persistence.
