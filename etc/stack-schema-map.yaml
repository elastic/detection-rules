# alignment of stack with beats and ecs versions
#    ECS versions do not align perfectly with stack releases (as of 7.13), so this will reflect MAX ecs version for a
#    given release

"7.13.0":
  # beats release about the same time as the stack, so we cannot update this until it is released
  beats: "7.13.2"
  ecs: "1.9.0"

"7.14.0":
  beats: "7.14.0"
  ecs: "1.11.0"

"7.15.0":
  beats: "master"  # TODO: update this once beats releases
  ecs: "1.11.0"
