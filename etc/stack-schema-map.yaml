# alignment of stack with beats and ecs versions
#    ECS versions do not align perfectly with stack releases (as of 7.13), so this will reflect MAX ecs version for a
#    given release

"7.13.0":
  # beats release about the same time as the stack, so we cannot update this until it is released
  # If not defined, it will defer to the latest non-master we have saved

  # beats: "7.13.0"
  # ecs: "1.9.0"
