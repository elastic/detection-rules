This hunting query identifies when a public client app fails to retrieve an OAuth access token using client credentials because of an uauthorized scope. Adversaries may attempt to retrieve access tokens using client credentials to bypass user authentication and access resources. This query identifies when a public client app fails to retrieve an access token using client credentials and scopes that are not implicitly granted.
