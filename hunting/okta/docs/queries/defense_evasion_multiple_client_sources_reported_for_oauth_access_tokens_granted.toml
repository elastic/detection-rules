This hunting query identifies when a public client app successfully retrieves an OAuth access token using client credentials from multiple client addresses. For public client applications in Okta that leverage OAuth, client credentials can be used to retrieve access tokens without user consent. Unsecured credentials may be compromised by an adversary whom may use them to request an access token on behalf of the public client app.
