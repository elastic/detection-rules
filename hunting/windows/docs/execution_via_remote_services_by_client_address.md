  process.Ext.session_info.logon_type == "Network" and
  (process.parent.name .caseless in ("wmiprvse.exe", "wsmprovhost.exe", "winrshost.exe") or (process.parent.name == "svchost.exe" and process.parent.args == "DcomLaunch"))
| stats total = count(*), hosts = count_distinct(host.id) by process.Ext.session_info.client_address, user.name, process.parent.name
