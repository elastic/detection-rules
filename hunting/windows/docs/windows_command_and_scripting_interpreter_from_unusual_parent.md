# Windows Command and Scripting Interpreter from Unusual Parent Process

---

## Metadata

- **Author:** Elastic
- **Description:** This hunt looks for unusual Microsoft native processes spawning `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe` or `conhost.exe` and limited to a unique host. This could be normal rare behavior as well as an interactive shell activity from an injected parent process to execute system commands.

- **UUID:** `de929347-c04a-4a94-8be2-cbe87b25bb25`
- **Integration:** [endpoint](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/endpoint), [windows](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/windows), [system](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/system)
- **Language:** `ES|QL`

## Query

```sql
from logs-endpoint.events.process-*, logs-windows.sysmon_operational-*, logs-system.security-*
| where  @timestamp > now() - 7 day
| where host.os.family == "windows" and event.category == "process" and event.action in ("start", "Process creation", "created-process") and
  to_lower(process.name) in ("cmd.exe", "powershell.exe", "conhost.exe") and
  (starts_with(to_lower(process.parent.executable), "c:\\windows\\system32") or starts_with(to_lower(process.parent.executable), "c:\\windows\\syswow64"))
| keep process.name, process.parent.name, host.id
| stats hosts = count_distinct(host.id), cc = count(*) by process.parent.name
| where cc <= 10 and hosts == 1
```

## Notes

- Further pivoting can be done via `process.parent.name`.
- Certain Microsoft binaries like LSASS, winlogon, spoolsv and others should never spawn `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe` or `conhost.exe`, if so it's highly likely malicious.
