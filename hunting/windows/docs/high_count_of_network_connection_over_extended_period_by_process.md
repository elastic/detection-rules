# High Count of Network Connection Over Extended Period by Process

---

## Metadata

- **Author:** Elastic
- **Description:** This hunt identifies browser or svchost instances performing a considerable number of connections per hour over an extended period of hours to a specific destination address, limited to a unique host of the monitored agents. Browsers and svchost are both good targets for masquerading network traffic on the endpoint.

- **UUID:** `ed254a22-e7bb-4a36-9291-196b77762dd8`
- **Integration:** [endpoint](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/endpoint), [windows](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/windows)
- **Language:** `ES|QL`
