## Metadata

## Query

```sql
from logs-endpoint.events.api*
| where  @timestamp > NOW() - 7 day
| where event.category == "api" and host.os.family == "windows" and process.Ext.api.name in ("OpenProcess", "OpenThread", "ReadProcessMemory") and
 Target.process.name == "lsass.exe"
| keep process.executable.caseless, host.id
 /* normalize process paths to reduce known random patterns in process.executable */
| eval process = replace(process.executable.caseless, """([0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}|ns[a-z][A-Z0-9]{3,4}\.tmp|DX[A-Z0-9]{3,4}\.tmp|7z[A-Z0-9]{3,5}\.tmp|[0-9\.\-\_]{3,})""", "")
| stats occurences = count(process), agents = count_distinct(host.id) by process
| where agents == 1 and occurences <= 10
```

## Notes

- Based on the process.executable and process.name you can pivot and investigate further the matching instances.
- Potential false positives include rare legit condition that may trigger this behavior due to third party software or Lsass crash.
