# Libraries Loaded by svchost with Low Occurrence Frequency

---

## Metadata

- **Author:** Elastic
- **Description:** This hunt returns the SHA256 hash and the `dll.path` of unsigned libraries loaded by svchost where the presence of unique path/hash is limited to a unique host. Adversaries may use Windows service DLLs to maintain persistence or run with System privileges.

- **UUID:** `e37fe0b9-1b70-4800-8989-58bac5a0a9bb`
- **Integration:** [endpoint](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/endpoint), [windows](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/windows)
- **Language:** `ES|QL`

## Notes

- This hunt includes two queries to cover both Sysmon and Elastic Defend data sources.
- The hunt uses Elastic Defend library events for an extra optional condition `dll.Ext.relative_file_creation_time` to scope if for recently dropped DLLs.
- The `count_dlls_per_folder` variable filter is used to avoid cases where multiple DLLs with different names are loaded from same directory (often observed in FPs loaded multiple dependencies from same dir).
- Pay close attention unknown hashes and suspicious paths, usually ServiceDLLs are located in trusted directories like `%programfiles%` and `system32/syswow64`.
