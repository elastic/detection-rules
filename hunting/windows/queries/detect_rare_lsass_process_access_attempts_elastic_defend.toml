This hunt identifies instances where a process attempts to open the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory and where the number of occurences is limited to one unique agent and a low number of attempts. This may indicate either a rare legitimate condition or a malicious process attempting to obtain credentials or inject code into the LSASS.
