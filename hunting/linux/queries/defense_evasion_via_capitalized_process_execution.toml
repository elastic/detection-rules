description = """
This hunt identifies potential defense evasion techniques via capitalized process execution on Linux systems. It detects processes that have two or more consecutive capital letters within their names, which can indicate an attempt to evade detection. Such naming conventions are often used in malicious payloads to blend in with legitimate processes.
