description = """
This hunt identifies low volume modifications to critical system binaries on Linux systems. It monitors file modification events in critical directories such as /bin, /usr/bin, /sbin, and /usr/sbin. The hunt focuses on modifications made by unique hosts, excluding expected update processes like package managers. This can help detect unauthorized or suspicious modifications to system binaries.
