author = "Elastic"
description = """
This hunt identifies potential persistence mechanisms via dynamic linker hijacking on Linux systems. Attackers can manipulate environment variables like LD_PRELOAD and LD_LIBRARY_PATH to execute malicious shared libraries, hijacking the dynamic linker process for persistence or privilege escalation. This hunt monitors for suspicious usage of these environment variables, the creation of shared library files (.so), and access to critical dynamic linker configuration files.
