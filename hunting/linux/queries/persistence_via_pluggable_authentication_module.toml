This hunt identifies potential persistence mechanisms leveraging Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) on Linux systems. PAM is a powerful framework for managing authentication-related tasks, but its flexibility can be abused by attackers to introduce malicious modules or modify configurations to gain unauthorized access or establish persistence. This hunt monitors for modifications to PAM-related files, directories, and modules.
