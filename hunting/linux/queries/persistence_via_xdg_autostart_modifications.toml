description = """
This hunt identifies potential persistence mechanisms via modifications to XDG autostart directories on Linux systems. XDG Autostart entries can be used to execute arbitrary commands or scripts when a user logs in. It monitors file creation or modification events in system-wide, user-specific, and root-specific autostart directories. Additionally, it monitors processes started by common Linux desktop session managers to detect suspicious activity related to autostart entries.
