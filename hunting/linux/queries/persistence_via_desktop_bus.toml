description = """
This hunt identifies potential persistence mechanisms leveraging the Desktop Bus (D-Bus) system on Linux. D-Bus is an inter-process communication (IPC) system that facilitates communication between various system components and applications. Attackers can exploit D-Bus by creating or modifying services, configuration files, or system policies to maintain persistence or execute unauthorized actions. This hunt monitors suspicious process activity related to D-Bus, tracks changes to key D-Bus configuration and service files, and retrieves metadata for further analysis. The approach helps analysts identify and respond to persistence techniques targeting D-Bus.
