author = "Elastic"
description = """
This hunt identifies potential persistence mechanisms leveraging the GRUB bootloader on Linux systems. GRUB, as the primary bootloader on many Linux distributions, can be manipulated by attackers to gain persistent access or control over the boot process. By monitoring file creations, modifications, and GRUB-related process executions, this hunt helps detect unauthorized changes that could indicate malicious activity. It also provides metadata about critical GRUB configuration files, supporting forensic analysis of potential threats.
