This hunting query gathers data for evidence of an adversary adding permissions to a Lambda function that allows write actions. The `AddPermission` API call to Lambda allows the adversary to add permissions to a Lambda function. This query identifies when the `AddPermission` API call is used to add permissions that allow write actions to a Lambda function. Adversaries may use this technique to grant themselves additional permissions to write to a Lambda function, which could be used to execute malicious code or exfiltrate data.
