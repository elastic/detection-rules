description = """
This hunting query identifies when a user signs in to the AWS Management Console using a federated session and single-factor authentication. Federated sessions are typically used by users who are not directly managed by AWS IAM or have temporary credentials. Single-factor authentication without MFA may indicate a security risk, as MFA adds an additional layer of security to the authentication process. This could also indicate the abuse of STS tokens to bypass MFA requirements.
