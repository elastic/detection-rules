description = """
This hunting query identifies instances where customer-managed IAM policies are attached to existing roles, potentially indicating a privilege escalation attempt. By detecting unexpected actors attaching customer-managed policies with elevated permissions to roles, this query helps identify potential abuse or misuse within AWS. Adversaries may attach these policies to gain unauthorized permissions or enable lateral movement and persistence within the environment.
