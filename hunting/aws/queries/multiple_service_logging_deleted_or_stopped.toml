This hunting query identifies the deletion or stopping of multiple service logging actions within AWS. Service logging is a critical security control that provides visibility into the activities and changes within AWS services. Adversaries may attempt to disable or delete service logging to evade detection and cover their tracks. Monitoring for multiple service logging deletions or stops can help identify potential malicious activity and ensure that critical security controls remain intact.
