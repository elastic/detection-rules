This hunting query gathers data from AWS CloudTrail logs to identify unusual AWS access key usage for a user. By detecting instances where an access key is used infrequently for a specific AWS event, this query helps identify potential misuse or abuse of AWS access keys. Adversaries may use access keys to gain unauthorized access to AWS resources, exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious activities within the environment.

"If the access key is associated with a specific role, review the permissions and policies associated with the role to determine the potential impact of the unusual access key usage.",
"If the access key is associated with an assumed role, review the resources assigned to the role. Consider pivoting on EC2 or Lambda-based roles if identified and examine session metadata within the last 24-hours.",

"If the access key is perminant and tied to a user or role, consider rotating the access key to prevent further unauthorized access."
