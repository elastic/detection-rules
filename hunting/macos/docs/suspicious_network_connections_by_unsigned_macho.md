```

## Notes

- This hunt aggregates by process ID and destination IP the number of connections per hour over a period of time greater than a defined threshold. The process paths are scoped to Microsoft signed binaries often injected or used as a lolbin to masquerade malicious execution. This could be a sign of long term network activity to perform command and control from an injected process.
- Hunt can be extended by adding suspicious process paths or lolbins.
