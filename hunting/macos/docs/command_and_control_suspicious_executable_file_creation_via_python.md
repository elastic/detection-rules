# Unsigned or Untrusted Binary Execution via Python

---

## Metadata

- **Author:** Elastic
- **Description:** Detects the execution of unsigned or untrusted binaries where the parent process is a Python interpreter. Adversaries often use Python as a launcher to run untrusted payloads, typically dropped to locations like `/tmp`, `/Users/Shared`, or public directories. This behavior is indicative of custom loaders, malware staging, or post-exploitation actions.

- **Integration:** [endpoint](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/endpoint)
- **Language:** `[EQL]`
- **Source File:** [Unsigned or Untrusted Binary Execution via Python](../queries/command_and_control_suspicious_executable_file_creation_via_python.toml)

## Query

```sql
process where event.type == "start" and event.action == "exec" and
  (process.code_signature.trusted == false or process.code_signature.exists == false) and
  process.parent.name like~ "python*" and
  (
    process.executable like "/Users/Shared/*" or
    process.executable like "/tmp/*" or
    process.executable like "/private/tmp/*" or
    process.executable like "/Users/*/Public/*" or
    process.name like ".*"
  )
```

## Notes

- Execution of untrusted binaries from Python in shared or temporary directories is rare in normal operations.
- This hunt is useful for detecting dropper-style behavior during post-exploitation or initial access.
- You may wish to enrich with file.hash or process.args to gain more triage context.
