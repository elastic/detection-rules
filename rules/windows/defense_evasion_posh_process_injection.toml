### Investigating Potential Process Injection via PowerShell

This rule Detects PowerShell scripts that references a combination of Win32 APIs commonly used to open a target process, allocate or change memory protections, write data into another process, and execute it via a remote thread or APC. This behavior is frequently associated with process injection and in-memory payload execution on Windows hosts.

#### Key alert fields to review

- `user.name`, `user.domain`, `user.id`: Account execution context for correlation, prioritization, and scoping.
- `host.name`, `host.id`: Host execution context for correlation, prioritization, and scoping.
- `powershell.file.script_block_text`: Script block content that matched the detection logic.
- `powershell.file.script_block_id`, `powershell.sequence`, `powershell.total`: Script block metadata to pivot to other fragments or reconstruct full script content when split across multiple events.
- `file.path`, `file.directory`, `file.name`: File-origin context when the script block is sourced from an on-disk file.
- `powershell.file.script_block_length`: Script block length (size) context.

#### Possible investigation steps

- Review and preserve the script content:
  - Inspect `powershell.file.script_block_text` for the full API chain and surrounding logic (function definitions, payload construction, and execution flow).
  - If the content is split across multiple events, reconstruct it by grouping on `powershell.file.script_block_id`, ordering by `powershell.sequence`, and validating completeness with `powershell.total`. Preserve the reconstructed content for follow-up analysis.
  - Use `powershell.file.script_block_length` to help gauge whether the script is a small launcher or a larger framework with embedded payloads.

- Identify the injection technique and likely target:
  - Determine which execution primitive is being used (for example, `CreateRemoteThread`, `NtCreateThreadEx`, `QueueUserAPC`, or thread `SuspendThread`/`ResumeThread` patterns) and whether it suggests immediate or deferred execution.
  - Look for how the target process is selected (process name strings, PID variables, or process enumeration logic) and capture any referenced process names or IDs for scoping.
  - Note any privilege manipulation via `OpenProcessToken` and `AdjustTokenPrivileges`, which can indicate attempts to access protected processes.

- Assess how native APIs are being invoked:
  - Identify dynamic resolution patterns such as `LoadLibrary*`/`LdrLoadDll` with `GetProcAddress`, which are commonly used to avoid static imports and hinder analysis.
  - If `GetDelegateForFunctionPointer` is present, review the surrounding text for delegate definitions and indirect invocation logic.

- Validate execution context and script provenance:
  - Review `user.name`, `user.domain`, and `user.id` for signs of unusual execution (unexpected account type, first-time observation on the host, or activity outside expected administrative workflows).
  - Review `host.name` and `host.id` to understand the asset impacted and whether the behavior aligns with the host's role in your environment.
  - If `file.path`, `file.directory`, or `file.name` are populated, assess whether the script originated from a controlled location and naming convention, or from a user-writable or temporary location.

- Scope related PowerShell activity:
  - On the same `host.id` and `user.id`, review additional script block events near `@timestamp` to identify staging actions that commonly bracket injection attempts (download, decode/decrypt, reflective loading, or cleanup).
  - Search for repeated use of distinctive substrings from `powershell.file.script_block_text` across other hosts or users to determine prevalence and potential reuse.

- Correlate with adjacent host telemetry (if available in your environment):
  - Pivot from `host.name` and `@timestamp` to process activity to identify the PowerShell host process, its parent process, and any processes that may have been targeted for injection.
  - Review network activity from the same `host.name` around the alert time for potential payload retrieval, command-and-control, or lateral movement.
  - Review file activity related to `file.path` (when present) and for any new or modified scripts or binaries referenced by the script block.

- Make a disposition:
  - Treat as higher risk when the script combines process access (`OpenProcess`), memory modification (`VirtualAlloc*`/`VirtualProtect`), and execution (`CreateRemoteThread`/`NtCreateThreadEx`/`QueueUserAPC`), especially when coupled with privilege adjustment or dynamic API resolution.
  - Treat as lower risk only when there is a clear, documented administrative or testing justification tied to the same `user.id`, `host.id`, and script origin.

### False positive analysis

- Legitimate PowerShell can use Win32 API interop for diagnostics, automation, or compatibility work; however, the combination of remote memory operations and remote execution APIs is uncommon in routine administration.
- Developer tooling or monitoring frameworks may load libraries or resolve symbols dynamically; validate that the script content aligns with expected tool behavior and that the script origin (`file.path`/`file.name`) is consistent and controlled.

### Response and remediation

- If the activity is confirmed or strongly suspected malicious:
  - Contain the affected host to prevent follow-on actions and lateral movement.
  - Preserve evidence by retaining the reconstructed `powershell.file.script_block_text` (and associated `powershell.file.script_block_id`) and recording the alert context (`user.*`, `host.*`, and `file.*` where present).
  - Identify the intended injection target from the script content and investigate that process and its recent activity for signs of compromise or anomalous behavior.
  - Review the associated user account activity for additional suspicious behavior on the same host and other hosts, and take appropriate account actions if compromise is suspected.
  - Hunt for the same script patterns across the environment using stable substrings from `powershell.file.script_block_text` and common `file.path`/`file.name` values, and remediate any additional impacted systems.

- If the activity is verified as benign:
  - Document the script purpose, owner, expected execution context (hosts and accounts), and expected script origin (`file.path`/`file.name`).
  - Consider controlled rule tuning using stable, high-confidence identifiers from the verified benign workflow to reduce repeat alerts while maintaining coverage for new or unauthorized variants.
