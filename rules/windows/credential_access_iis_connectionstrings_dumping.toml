### Investigating Microsoft IIS Connection Strings Decryption

Microsoft IIS often stores sensitive connection strings in encrypted form to secure database credentials. The `aspnet_regiis` tool can decrypt these strings, a feature intended for legitimate administrative tasks. However, attackers with access to the IIS server, possibly via a webshell, can exploit this to extract credentials. The detection rule identifies suspicious use of `aspnet_regiis` by monitoring process execution with specific arguments, flagging potential credential access attempts.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the process execution details to confirm the presence of aspnet_regiis.exe with the specific arguments "connectionStrings" and "-pdf" to ensure the alert is not a false positive.
- Check the user account associated with the process execution to determine if it is a legitimate administrative account or a potentially compromised one.
- Investigate the source of the process initiation by examining the parent process and any related processes to identify if a webshell or unauthorized script triggered the execution.
- Analyze recent login activities and access logs on the IIS server to identify any unusual or unauthorized access patterns that could indicate a compromise.
- Review the server's security logs and any available network traffic data to detect any signs of data exfiltration or further malicious activity following the decryption attempt.
- Assess the integrity and security of the IIS server by checking for any unauthorized changes or suspicious files that may have been introduced by an attacker.

### False positive analysis

- Routine administrative tasks using aspnet_regiis for legitimate configuration changes can trigger the rule. To manage this, create exceptions for known maintenance windows or specific administrator accounts performing these tasks.
- Automated deployment scripts that include aspnet_regiis for setting up or updating IIS configurations may cause false positives. Exclude these scripts by identifying their unique process arguments or execution paths.
- Scheduled tasks or services that periodically run aspnet_regiis for configuration validation or updates might be flagged. Document these tasks and exclude them based on their scheduled times or associated service accounts.
- Development environments where developers frequently use aspnet_regiis for testing purposes can generate alerts. Consider excluding specific development servers or user accounts from the rule to reduce noise.
- Security tools or monitoring solutions that simulate attacks for testing purposes may inadvertently trigger the rule. Coordinate with security teams to whitelist these tools or their specific test scenarios.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately isolate the affected IIS server from the network to prevent further unauthorized access and potential data exfiltration.
- Terminate any suspicious processes related to aspnet_regiis.exe to halt any ongoing decryption attempts.
- Conduct a thorough review of IIS server logs and webshell activity to identify the source of the compromise and any other affected systems.
- Change all credentials associated with the decrypted connection strings, including database passwords and service account credentials, to prevent unauthorized access.
- Restore the IIS server from a known good backup taken before the compromise, ensuring that any webshells or malicious scripts are removed.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for any future unauthorized use of aspnet_regiis.exe, focusing on the specific arguments used in the detection query.
- Escalate the incident to the security operations center (SOC) or relevant incident response team for further investigation and to assess the broader impact on the organization."""
