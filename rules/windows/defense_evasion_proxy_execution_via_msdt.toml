### Investigating Suspicious Microsoft Diagnostics Wizard Execution

The Microsoft Diagnostics Troubleshooting Wizard (MSDT) is a legitimate tool used for diagnosing and resolving issues within Windows environments. However, adversaries can exploit MSDT to execute malicious commands by manipulating its process arguments, effectively using it as a proxy for harmful activities. The detection rule identifies such abuse by monitoring for unusual execution patterns, such as atypical file paths, unexpected parent processes, and non-standard executable locations, which are indicative of potential misuse. This proactive detection helps in mitigating risks associated with defense evasion tactics.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the process arguments to identify any suspicious patterns, such as "IT_RebrowseForFile=*", "ms-msdt:/id", "ms-msdt:-id", or "*FromBase64*", which may indicate malicious intent.
- Examine the parent process of msdt.exe to determine if it was launched by an unexpected or potentially malicious process like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, or mshta.exe.
- Check the file path of the msdt.exe executable to ensure it matches the standard locations (?:\\Windows\\system32\\msdt.exe or ?:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\msdt.exe) and investigate any deviations.
- Investigate the user account associated with the process execution to determine if the activity aligns with their typical behavior or if it appears suspicious.
- Correlate the event with other security alerts or logs from data sources like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint or Sysmon to identify any related malicious activities or patterns.
- Assess the risk score and severity of the alert to prioritize the investigation and determine if immediate action is required to mitigate potential threats.

### False positive analysis

- Legitimate troubleshooting activities by IT staff using MSDT may trigger alerts. To manage this, create exceptions for known IT user accounts or specific machines frequently used for diagnostics.
- Automated scripts or software updates that utilize MSDT for legitimate purposes can cause false positives. Identify these scripts and whitelist their execution paths or parent processes.
- Custom diagnostic tools that leverage MSDT might be flagged. Review these tools and exclude their specific process arguments or executable paths if they are verified as safe.
- Non-standard installations of MSDT in custom environments could be misidentified. Ensure that any legitimate non-standard paths are documented and excluded from monitoring.
- Frequent use of MSDT in virtualized environments for testing purposes may lead to alerts. Consider excluding these environments or specific virtual machines from the rule.

### Response and remediation

- Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further malicious activity and lateral movement.
- Terminate the suspicious msdt.exe process to stop any ongoing malicious execution.
- Conduct a thorough scan of the affected system using updated antivirus or endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to identify and remove any additional malicious files or processes.
- Review and analyze the process arguments and parent processes associated with the msdt.exe execution to identify potential entry points or related malicious activities.
- Restore any affected files or system components from a known good backup to ensure system integrity.
- Escalate the incident to the security operations center (SOC) or incident response team for further investigation and to determine if additional systems are compromised.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and logging for msdt.exe and related processes to detect and respond to similar threats in the future."""
