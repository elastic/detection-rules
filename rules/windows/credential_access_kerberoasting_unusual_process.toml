### Investigating Kerberos Traffic from Unusual Process

Kerberos is the default authentication protocol in Active Directory, designed to provide strong authentication for
client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography.

Domain-joined hosts usually perform Kerberos traffic using the `lsass.exe` process. This rule detects the occurrence of
traffic on the Kerberos port (88) by processes other than `lsass.exe` to detect the potential request and usage of
Kerberos tickets.

#### Possible investigation steps:

- Investigate script execution chain (parent process tree).
- Investigate other alerts related to the host and user in the last 48 hours.
- Check if the Destination IP is related to a Domain Controller.
- Review event ID 4769 for suspicious ticket requests.

### False Positive Analysis

- This rule is based on the port related to Kerberos but does not identify the used protocol. HTTP traffic on a
non-standard port or destination IP address unrelated to Domain controllers can be false positives.
- Exceptions can be added for noisy/frequent connections done in the environment.

### Response and Remediation

- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.
- Scope possible compromised credentials based on ticket requests.
- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
