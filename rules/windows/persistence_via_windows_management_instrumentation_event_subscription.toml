An adversary can use Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to install event filters, providers, consumers, and

event and execute arbitrary code when that event occurs, providing persistence on a system.

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.
