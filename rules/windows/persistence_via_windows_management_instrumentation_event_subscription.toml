An adversary can use Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to install event filters, providers, consumers, and
bindings that execute code when a defined event occurs. Adversaries may use the capabilities of WMI to subscribe to an
event and execute arbitrary code when that event occurs, providing persistence on a system.
