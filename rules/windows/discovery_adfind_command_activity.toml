This rule detects the Active Directory query tool, AdFind.exe. AdFind has legitimate purposes, but it is frequently
leveraged by threat actors to perform post-exploitation Active Directory reconnaissance. The AdFind tool has been
observed in Trickbot, Ryuk, Maze, and FIN6 campaigns. For Winlogbeat, this rule requires Sysmon.

`AdFind.exe` is a legitimate domain query tool.
