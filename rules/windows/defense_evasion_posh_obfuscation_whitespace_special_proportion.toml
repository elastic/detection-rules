### Investigating Potential PowerShell Obfuscation via Special Character Overuse

This rule flags PowerShell script block content that is unusually long and dominated by whitespace and a narrow set of special characters. This profile is often associated with formatting or encoding obfuscation where payload logic is transformed into symbol-heavy strings and reconstructed at runtime. Use the steps below to validate execution context, reconstruct full content, determine likely intent, and scope related activity.

#### Key alert fields to review

- `user.name`, `user.domain`, `user.id`: Account execution context for correlation, prioritization, and scoping.
- `host.name`, `host.id`: Host execution context for correlation, prioritization, and scoping.
- `file.path`, `file.directory`, `file.name`: File-origin context when the script block is sourced from an on-disk file.
- `powershell.file.script_block_text`: Script block content that matched the detection logic.
- `powershell.file.script_block_id`, `powershell.sequence`, `powershell.total`: Script block metadata to pivot to other fragments or reconstruct full script content when split across multiple events.
- `Esql.script_block_tmp`: Transformed script block where detection patterns replace original content with a marker to support scoring/counting and quickly spot match locations.
- `Esql.script_block_ratio`: Proportion of the script block's characters that match the alert's target character set, divided by total script length (0-1).
- `Esql.script_block_pattern_count`: Count of matches for the detection pattern(s) observed in the script block content.
- `powershell.file.script_block_entropy_bits`: Shannon entropy of the script block. Higher values may indicate obfuscation.
- `powershell.file.script_block_surprisal_stdev`: Standard deviation of surprisal across the script block. Low values indicate uniform randomness. High values indicate mixed patterns and variability.
- `powershell.file.script_block_unique_symbols`: Count of distinct characters present in the script block.
- `powershell.file.script_block_length`: Script block length (size) context.

#### Possible investigation steps

- Review alert context and scope:
  - Use `@timestamp` to identify when the activity occurred and to bound the timeline for correlation.
  - Review `host.name` and `host.id` to understand which endpoint produced the script block.
  - Review `user.name`, `user.domain`, and `user.id` to determine whether the account is expected to run PowerShell on this host.
  - If multiple alerts are present, group by `host.id` and `user.id` to identify concentrated or repeat activity.

- Analyze the script block content for obfuscation and intent:
  - Inspect `powershell.file.script_block_text` to understand what is being executed. Obfuscation commonly presents as large blocks of escaped characters, excessive punctuation, and character-level reassembly.
  - Use `Esql.script_block_tmp` to quickly locate symbol-dense regions, then interpret the corresponding content in `powershell.file.script_block_text`.
  - Use `Esql.script_block_ratio`, `powershell.file.script_block_unique_symbols`, `powershell.file.script_block_entropy_bits`, and `powershell.file.script_block_surprisal_stdev` to gauge how atypical the content is compared to known-good scripts in your environment.
  - Identify deobfuscation and runtime execution patterns such as repeated string replacement, concatenation, `[char]` casting, `-join`, formatting operators, reflection, and dynamic invocation (for example, `Invoke-Expression` or executing decoded strings).
  - Capture any embedded indicators from `powershell.file.script_block_text`, including URLs, hostnames, IP addresses, file paths, registry paths, or scheduled task/service names.

- Reconstruct full script content when logged in chunks:
  - If `powershell.total` indicates multiple fragments, pivot on `powershell.file.script_block_id` and reassemble the script in `powershell.sequence` order.
  - Confirm completeness by comparing observed fragments to `powershell.total`. Missing segments can hide key decode or execution stages.

- Validate script origin and expected usage:
  - Review `file.path`, `file.directory`, and `file.name` (when present) to determine whether the script originated from disk, a module path, or an unusual location.
  - If the script is file-backed, assess whether the file location and naming are consistent with approved administration and automation practices for the host and user.

- Scope for related PowerShell activity:
  - Pivot on `powershell.file.script_block_hash` (when available) to identify repeated executions of the same content across hosts and users.
  - Review additional script blocks on the same `host.id` and `user.id` around the alert time for staging behavior (variable setup, decoding routines, or creation of additional script blocks).
  - Use stable substrings from `powershell.file.script_block_text` (unique function names or strings) to find related executions that may not match this specific obfuscation profile.

- Correlate with adjacent telemetry to confirm execution chain and impact (if available):
  - Use `host.id`, `user.id`, and `@timestamp` to pivot into process telemetry and determine which process initiated PowerShell and whether the parent process is expected.
  - Review activity on the same host around the alert time for signs of follow-on behavior such as outbound connections, file creation/modification, registry changes, or persistence mechanisms consistent with the recovered script logic.

### False positive analysis

- Legitimate automation can embed large protected or serialized values (for example, encrypted configuration blobs or SecureString exports) that appear symbol-heavy.
- Deployment and configuration tooling may generate templated PowerShell with extensive escaping or large here-strings, especially when embedding JSON/XML or code as data.
- Authorized security testing may use obfuscation techniques that resemble this behavior.
- To validate a benign source, confirm the script's provenance and repeatability:
  - Check whether `file.path` (when present) and `powershell.file.script_block_hash` consistently map to an approved script, owner, and expected execution pattern.
  - Compare the alerting `user.id` and `host.id` against known automation accounts and managed endpoints; unexpected combinations warrant escalation.

### Response and remediation

- If malicious or suspicious activity is confirmed:
  - Contain the affected host according to your incident response procedures to prevent additional execution and lateral movement.
  - Preserve evidence for triage and forensics, including `powershell.file.script_block_text` (and any reconstructed content), `powershell.file.script_block_id`, `powershell.sequence`, `powershell.total`, `powershell.file.script_block_hash` (if available), `file.path` (if present), and the execution context (`host.name`, `host.id`, `user.name`, `user.domain`, `user.id`, `agent.id`, `@timestamp`).
  - Scope the activity by searching for the same `powershell.file.script_block_hash` and any extracted indicators across the environment.
  - Identify and remediate follow-on actions associated with the script (downloaded payloads, dropped files, persistence changes, or credential access). Apply blocking controls for confirmed indicators where feasible.
  - If the script content indicates credential material handling or unauthorized automation, rotate affected credentials and review account activity for misuse.

- If the activity is determined to be benign:
  - Document the script owner, purpose, and expected execution context (hosts, users, and schedule), using `file.path` and `powershell.file.script_block_hash` (when available) as stable identifiers.
  - Monitor for drift, such as execution by different users/hosts, unexpected file paths, or material changes in the script block content.
