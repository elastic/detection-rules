### Investigating Command Obfuscation via Unicode Modifier Letters

Adversaries sometimes replace ASCII characters with visually similar Unicode modifier letters or combining marks to evade simple string-based detections.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the process execution details (command_line, parent, code signature, hash).
- Analyze the full execution process tree to identify the root cause.
- Check the creation of any persistence  using scheduled tasks, Run key, services, shortcuts or startup folders.
- Cross-reference with other logs or alerts to identify any related incidents or patterns of activity that might indicate a larger threat campaign.

### False positive analysis

- Legitimate internationalized applications and installers use Unicode (e.g., localized product names, non-Latin scripts).
- Dev tools or fonts may create commands with combining marks (rare) — check installer/tool provenance.
- Command lines that include user input, file names, or paths with non-ASCII characters (e.g., user folders) can trigger the rule.

### Response and remediation

- Isolate the host if there are signs of active compromise (outbound C2, credential theft, lateral movement).
- Terminate the suspicious process and any direct descendants after collecting forensic evidence (memory, artifacts).
- Collect EDR snapshots, full disk image or targeted file copies, registry hives, and network logs for investigation.
- Remove any persistence entries (scheduled task, startup, services) tied to the activity.
- Qurantine and submit samples to malware analysis; if confirmed malicious, remove and restore from known good backups.
- Block and update indicators related to this activity (hashes, exact normalized command patterns, codepoint sequences, IPs/domains).
- Run global hutning queries for same Unicode patterns, normalized variants, and identical parent/child process chains.
