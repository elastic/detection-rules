### Investigating Potential Account Takeover - Logon from New Source IP

An account that historically logs in many times from a single source IP (e.g. usual workstation or VPN) and then shows successful logons from exactly one other IP with a low count may indicate credential compromise and use from a new location (account takeover).

### Possible investigation steps

- Confirm with the account owner whether they recently logged in from the new source IP or from a new device/location.
- Check the new source IP for reputation, geography, and whether it is expected (e.g. corporate VPN range vs unknown).
- Correlate with other alerts for the same user or source IP (e.g. logon failures, password changes, MFA changes).
- Review timeline: if the "new" IP logon is very recent compared to the high-count IP, treat as higher priority.

### False positive analysis

- Legitimate use from a second device (e.g. new laptop, second office, VPN from travel) can produce exactly two IPs with one IP having few logons. Tune threshold (e.g. max_logon >= 100) or add exclusions for known VPN/remote ranges if needed.
- Service or shared accounts that are used from multiple jump hosts or scripts may show two IPs; consider excluding known service accounts.

### Response and remediation

- If takeover is confirmed: force password reset, revoke sessions, and enable or enforce MFA. Disable or lock the account until the user verifies identity.
- Investigate how credentials may have been compromised (phishing, breach, endpoint) and address the vector.
