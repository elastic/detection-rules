### Investigating Suspicious Execution via Microsoft Office Add-Ins

Microsoft Office Add-Ins enhance productivity by integrating additional features into Office applications. However, adversaries can exploit this by embedding malicious code within add-ins, often delivered through phishing. The detection rule identifies unusual execution patterns, such as Office apps launching add-ins from suspicious paths or with atypical parent processes, signaling potential threats. It filters out known benign activities to minimize false positives, focusing on genuine anomalies indicative of malicious intent.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the process name and arguments to confirm if the execution involves a Microsoft Office application launching an add-in from a suspicious path, as indicated by the process.name and process.args fields.
- Check the parent process name to determine if the Office application was launched by an unusual or potentially malicious parent process, such as cmd.exe or powershell.exe, using the process.parent.name field.
- Investigate the file path from which the add-in was executed to assess if it matches any of the suspicious paths listed in the query, such as the Temp or Downloads directories, using the process.args field.
- Examine the host's recent activity logs to identify any related events or patterns that might indicate a broader attack or compromise, focusing on the host.os.type and event.type fields.
- Correlate the alert with any recent phishing attempts or suspicious emails received by the user to determine if the execution is part of a phishing campaign, leveraging the MITRE ATT&CK tactic and technique information provided.
- Verify if the execution is a false positive by checking against the known benign activities excluded in the query, such as specific VSTOInstaller.exe paths or arguments, to rule out legitimate software installations or updates.

### False positive analysis

- Logitech software installations can trigger false positives when VSTO files are executed by Logitech's PlugInInstallerUtility. To mitigate this, exclude processes with paths related to Logitech installations from the detection rule.
- The VSTOInstaller.exe process may be flagged when uninstalling applications. Exclude processes with the /Uninstall argument to prevent these false positives.
- Rundll32.exe executing with specific arguments related to MSI temporary files can be benign. Exclude these specific rundll32.exe executions to avoid false alerts.
- Sidekick.vsto installations from the specified URL can be legitimate. Exclude this specific VSTOInstaller.exe process with the Sidekick.vsto argument to reduce false positives.

### Response and remediation

- Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread of the potential threat and to contain any ongoing malicious activity.
- Terminate any suspicious processes identified by the detection rule, such as those involving unusual parent processes or originating from suspicious paths.
- Conduct a thorough scan of the affected system using updated antivirus or endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to identify and remove any malicious add-ins or related malware.
- Review and clean up any unauthorized or suspicious Office add-ins from the affected applications to ensure no malicious code remains.
- Restore the system from a known good backup if the integrity of the system is compromised and cannot be assured through cleaning alone.
- Escalate the incident to the security operations center (SOC) or incident response team for further investigation and to determine if additional systems are affected.
- Implement additional monitoring and alerting for similar suspicious activities to enhance detection and response capabilities for future incidents."""
