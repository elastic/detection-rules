### Investigating Windows User Account Creation

Windows user accounts are essential for managing access and permissions within a system or domain. Adversaries may exploit this by creating unauthorized accounts to maintain persistence or escalate privileges. The detection rule leverages event logs, specifically targeting account creation events, to identify suspicious activities. By monitoring these logs, security analysts can detect and respond to potential threats effectively.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the event logs for event.code "4720" or event.action "added-user-account" to identify the specific account creation event.
- Determine the source of the account creation by examining the event.module field to see if it originated from the "system" or "security" module.
- Identify the user account that initiated the account creation by checking the associated user information in the event logs.
- Investigate the context around the time of the account creation event, such as other related events or anomalies, to assess if it aligns with normal administrative activities.
- Check for any recent privilege escalation activities or changes in user permissions that might be associated with the newly created account.
- Correlate the account creation event with other security alerts or logs to identify potential patterns of malicious behavior or persistence tactics.

### False positive analysis

- Routine administrative tasks may trigger account creation events. Regularly review and document legitimate administrative activities to differentiate them from suspicious actions.
- Automated scripts or software installations that create user accounts can generate false positives. Identify and whitelist these processes to prevent unnecessary alerts.
- Temporary accounts for contractors or short-term projects might be flagged. Implement a naming convention for such accounts and exclude them from alerts based on this pattern.
- System updates or patches that involve account creation could be misinterpreted as threats. Monitor update schedules and correlate them with account creation events to verify legitimacy.
- Accounts created by trusted third-party management tools should be recognized and excluded. Maintain an updated list of these tools and configure exceptions accordingly.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement by the adversary.
- Review the newly created user account details, including the username, creation time, and associated privileges, to assess the potential impact and scope of the threat.
- Disable or delete the unauthorized user account to eliminate the adversary's persistence mechanism.
- Conduct a thorough review of recent account creation logs and correlate with other security events to identify any additional unauthorized accounts or related suspicious activities.
- Escalate the incident to the security operations center (SOC) or incident response team for further investigation and to determine if additional systems are compromised.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for account creation events, focusing on unusual patterns or deviations from normal behavior to improve early detection of similar threats.
- Review and update access control policies and user account management procedures to prevent unauthorized account creation and ensure adherence to the principle of least privilege."""
