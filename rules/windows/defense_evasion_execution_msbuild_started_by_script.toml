### Investigating Microsoft Build Engine Started by a Script Process

The Microsoft Build Engine (MSBuild) is a platform for building applications, typically invoked by developers. However, adversaries exploit its ability to execute inline tasks, using it as a proxy for executing malicious code. The detection rule identifies unusual MSBuild invocations initiated by script interpreters, signaling potential misuse for stealthy execution or defense evasion tactics.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the process tree to understand the parent-child relationship, focusing on the parent process names such as cmd.exe, powershell.exe, pwsh.exe, powershell_ise.exe, cscript.exe, wscript.exe, or mshta.exe, which initiated the msbuild.exe process.
- Examine the command line arguments used to start msbuild.exe to identify any suspicious or unusual inline tasks or scripts that may indicate malicious activity.
- Check the user account associated with the msbuild.exe process to determine if it aligns with expected usage patterns or if it might be compromised.
- Investigate the timing and frequency of the msbuild.exe execution to see if it coincides with known legitimate build activities or if it appears anomalous.
- Look for any related network activity or file modifications around the time of the msbuild.exe execution to identify potential data exfiltration or further malicious actions.
- Cross-reference the alert with other security events or logs to identify any correlated indicators of compromise or additional suspicious behavior.

### False positive analysis

- Development environments where scripts are used to automate builds may trigger this rule. To manage this, identify and whitelist specific script processes or directories commonly used by developers.
- Automated testing frameworks that utilize scripts to initiate builds can cause false positives. Exclude these processes by creating exceptions for known testing tools and their associated scripts.
- Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines often use scripts to invoke MSBuild. Consider excluding the parent processes associated with these pipelines from the rule.
- Administrative scripts that perform legitimate system maintenance tasks might start MSBuild. Review and exclude these scripts if they are verified as non-threatening.
- Custom scripts developed in-house for specific business functions may also trigger alerts. Conduct a review of these scripts and exclude them if they are deemed safe and necessary for operations.

### Response and remediation

- Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further malicious activity and lateral movement.
- Terminate the suspicious MSBuild process and any associated script interpreter processes (e.g., cmd.exe, powershell.exe) to stop the execution of potentially malicious code.
- Conduct a thorough scan of the affected system using updated antivirus or endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to identify and remove any malicious payloads or artifacts.
- Review and analyze the parent script or command that initiated the MSBuild process to understand the scope and intent of the attack, and identify any additional compromised systems or accounts.
- Reset credentials for any user accounts that were active on the affected system during the time of the alert to prevent unauthorized access.
- Escalate the incident to the security operations center (SOC) or incident response team for further investigation and to determine if additional systems are affected.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and logging for MSBuild and script interpreter activities across the network to detect and respond to similar threats in the future."""
