description = """
This rule leverages alert data from the building block rule "External IP Lookup from Non-Browser Process" to alert on
signals with unusual unique host.id, user.id and process.executable entries. The original underlying rule identifies 
domains commonly used by adversaries for post-exploitation IP lookups. It is common for adversaries to test for internet
access and acquire their external IP address after they have gained access to a system. Among others, this has been 
observed in campaigns leveraging the information stealer, Trickbot.
