### Investigating Potential Priivilege Escalation via InstallerFileTakeOver

InstallerFileTakeOver is a weaponized EoP PoC to the CVE-2021-41379 vulnerability. Upon successful exploitation,
an unprivileged user will escalate privileges to SYSTEM/NT AUTHORITY.

This rule detects the default execution of the PoC, which overwrites the `elevation_service.exe` DACL and copies itself
to the location to escalate privileges. An attacker is able to still take over any file that is not in use (locked), which is outside the scope of this rule.

#### Possible investigation steps:

- Check for the digital signature of the executable.
- Look for additional processes spawned by the process, command lines, and network communications.
- Look for additional alerts involving the host and the user.

### False Positive Analysis

- Verify whether the digital signature exists in the executable, and if it is valid.

### Related Rules

- Suspicious DLL Loaded for Persistence or Privilege Escalation - bfeaf89b-a2a7-48a3-817f-e41829dc61ee

### Response and Remediation

- Immediate response steps should be taken to validate, investigate, and potentially contain the activity to prevent
further post-compromise behavior.


## Config

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.
