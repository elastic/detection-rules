### Investigating Potential PowerShell Pass-the-Hash/Relay Script

This alert indicates PowerShell script block content consistent with low-level NTLM and SMB/SMB2 negotiation handling. These artifacts are commonly embedded in credential relay and pass-the-hash tooling and can be associated with credential access and lateral movement activity.

#### Key alert fields to review

- `user.name`, `user.domain`, `user.id`: Account execution context for correlation, prioritization, and scoping.
- `host.name`, `host.id`: Host execution context for correlation, prioritization, and scoping.
- `powershell.file.script_block_text`: Script block content that matched the detection logic.
- `powershell.file.script_block_id`, `powershell.sequence`, `powershell.total`: Script block metadata to pivot to other fragments or reconstruct full script content when split across multiple events.
- `file.path`, `file.directory`, `file.name`: File-origin context when the script block is sourced from an on-disk file.
- `powershell.file.script_block_length`: Script block length (size) context.

#### Possible investigation steps

- Review `powershell.file.script_block_text` to understand capability and intent:
  - Identify whether the script is building, parsing, or transmitting NTLMSSP messages and SMB/SMB2 negotiation data (often represented as hex strings or byte arrays).
  - Determine whether the logic aligns more closely with:
    - A capture/relay workflow (for example, listener-style components, authentication forwarding, or multiple inbound and outbound endpoints), or
    - A pass-the-hash style workflow (for example, authentication material variables combined with remote access or remote execution logic).
  - Note any tool identifiers, function names, or comments that resemble known PowerShell relay/PtH frameworks (for example, Inveigh, Invoke-TheHash, Invoke-SMBExec, Invoke-WMIExec, or Invoke-Tater).
  - Extract any referenced remote targets or infrastructure (hostnames, IP addresses, UNC paths, share names, or URLs) and record them for scoping and downstream validation.

- Reconstruct the complete script when the content is split across multiple events:
  - Pivot on `powershell.file.script_block_id` and order fragments by `powershell.sequence`; use `powershell.total` to confirm the script is complete.
  - Review other script blocks for the same host and user around the alert time to capture configuration values, embedded payloads, or follow-on actions not present in the matching fragment.

- Establish execution context and expectedness:
  - Validate the execution context using `host.name`, `host.id`, `user.name`, `user.domain`, and `user.id`.
  - Prioritize investigation when the executing account is privileged, rarely uses PowerShell on the host, or when the host is a server or administrative jump system.
  - Use `powershell.file.script_block_length` to help gauge whether this resembles embedded tooling (larger or highly structured blocks) versus incidental string handling.

- Identify script origin (when file context is available):
  - If `file.path`, `file.directory`, or `file.name` are present, determine whether the script originated from disk and whether the location and naming align with approved scripts and expected operators.
  - Treat scripts sourced from user-writable or temporary locations as higher risk, especially when combined with protocol-crafting logic.

- Correlate with adjacent telemetry to understand how PowerShell was launched and what occurred afterward (if available in your environment):
  - Review process activity near `@timestamp` on the same host to identify the PowerShell host process and its parent process, and whether execution appears interactive, scheduled, or remotely initiated.
  - Review network and authentication activity from the same host and user near the alert time for evidence of SMB or other NTLM-based authentication attempts to multiple targets, repeated failures, or unusual destination systems.
  - Look for short-following activity consistent with lateral movement (for example, remote management actions, remote execution behaviors, or additional suspicious PowerShell script blocks).

- Expand the scope and hunt for related activity:
  - Search for additional occurrences of distinctive strings or byte patterns from `powershell.file.script_block_text` across other hosts to identify reuse of the same tooling or broader compromise.
  - Review other alerts tied to the same `user.id` and `host.id` within a broader window to identify credential access precursors, staging behavior, or persistence attempts.

### False positive analysis

- False positives can occur during authorized security testing, incident response, or troubleshooting where scripts intentionally craft or parse NTLM/SMB protocol messages.
- Validate whether the activity is expected by confirming the script owner (when `file.path` is present), the approved operator, and whether the host and account match the intended scope for such work.
- Benign administrative automation rarely embeds raw NTLMSSP/SMB negotiation byte sequences; prioritize additional review when the script content implements low-level protocol logic or includes relay-style workflows.

### Response and remediation

- If malicious or unauthorized activity is suspected:
  - Contain the affected host to reduce the risk of credential interception and lateral movement.
  - Preserve evidence, including the full reconstructed script content, relevant PowerShell log events, and any on-disk script files referenced by `file.path`.
  - Identify potentially impacted accounts using `user.name`, `user.domain`, and `user.id`; take credential containment actions per policy (for example, password resets, revocation of exposed credentials, and review of privileged access).
  - Investigate potential lateral movement by reviewing activity on any systems referenced in the script content and by hunting for the same script patterns across other hosts.

- If the activity is confirmed benign:
  - Document the business justification and expected host/account scope, and ensure appropriate approvals are in place.
  - Apply targeted tuning using stable attributes such as known script paths, approved execution accounts, or consistent script content patterns.
