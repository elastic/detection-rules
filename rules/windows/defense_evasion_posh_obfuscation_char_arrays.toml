### Investigating Potential PowerShell Obfuscation via Character Array Reconstruction

PowerShell, a powerful scripting language, is often targeted by adversaries for obfuscation to bypass security measures. By reconstructing strings from character arrays, attackers evade static analysis and detection. The detection rule identifies scripts using such obfuscation by searching for patterns indicative of character array manipulation, thus flagging potential threats for further investigation.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the powershell.file.script_block_text field to understand the content and intent of the script, focusing on the obfuscated parts indicated by the presence of the "char" keyword and the ðŸ”¥ character.
- Examine the file.path and host.name fields to determine the origin and location of the script execution, which can provide context about the environment and potential risk.
- Check the user.id and agent.id fields to identify the user and agent responsible for executing the script, which can help assess whether the activity is expected or suspicious.
- Analyze the powershell.file.script_block_id and powershell.sequence fields to trace the execution sequence and correlate it with other related script blocks, providing a broader view of the script's behavior.
- Investigate the count field to assess the extent of obfuscation, as a higher count may indicate more complex or extensive obfuscation techniques being used.

### False positive analysis

- Scripts used for legitimate administrative tasks may use character arrays for performance optimization or to handle special characters. Review the script's purpose and context to determine if it aligns with known administrative functions.
- PowerShell scripts from trusted sources or vendors might use character arrays for legitimate obfuscation to protect intellectual property. Verify the script's origin and check for digital signatures or hashes to confirm authenticity.
- Automated scripts generated by development tools or frameworks could include character array manipulation as part of their standard output. Identify and whitelist these tools if they are commonly used in your environment.
- Security tools or monitoring solutions might use character arrays in their scripts for legitimate purposes. Cross-reference with known security software and consider excluding these from the detection rule if they are verified as safe.
- Regularly update the exclusion list to include new trusted scripts or tools as they are introduced into the environment, ensuring that legitimate activities are not flagged as false positives.

### Response and remediation

- Isolate the affected host immediately to prevent further spread of potentially malicious scripts or unauthorized access.
- Terminate any suspicious PowerShell processes identified by the alert to halt ongoing obfuscation activities.
- Conduct a thorough review of the script block text and associated logs to identify any malicious payloads or commands executed.
- Remove any identified malicious scripts or files from the affected system to prevent re-execution.
- Reset credentials for any user accounts involved in the alert to mitigate potential credential compromise.
- Update endpoint protection and ensure that AMSI and other security features are fully enabled and configured to detect similar threats.
- Escalate the incident to the security operations center (SOC) for further analysis and to determine if additional systems are affected.
