Identifies PowerShell scripts that use character arrays and runtime string reconstruction as a form of obfuscation. This
technique breaks strings into individual characters, often using constructs like char[] with index-based access or
joining logic. These methods are designed to evade static analysis and bypass security protections such as the
Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI).
