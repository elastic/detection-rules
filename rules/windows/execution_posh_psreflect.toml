### Investigating PowerShell PSReflect Script

This rule detects PowerShell scripts consistent with PSReflect-style helpers used to dynamically define in-memory .NET types and invoke Win32 APIs via interop (for example, Add-Win32Type, New-InMemoryModule, and DllImport patterns). This technique can be used for legitimate administration and development, but it is also commonly used by adversaries to access native capabilities from PowerShell.

#### Key alert fields to review

- `user.name`, `user.domain`, `user.id`: Account execution context for correlation, prioritization, and scoping.
- `host.name`, `host.id`: Host execution context for correlation, prioritization, and scoping.
- `powershell.file.script_block_text`: Script block content that matched the detection logic.
- `powershell.file.script_block_id`, `powershell.sequence`, `powershell.total`: Script block metadata to pivot to other fragments or reconstruct full script content when split across multiple events.
- `file.path`, `file.directory`, `file.name`: File-origin context when the script block is sourced from an on-disk file.
- `powershell.file.script_block_length`: Script block length (size) context.

#### Possible investigation steps

- Review the alert context to prioritize the investigation:
  - Identify the affected host (`host.name`, `host.id`) and the execution context (`user.name`, `user.domain`, `user.id`).
  - Use `@timestamp` to scope a short timeline around the activity and identify related alerts on the same host or user.
  - Treat activity as higher risk when the executing account is unexpected for PowerShell development/administration or when the host is not typically used for scripting.

- Reconstruct the complete script block content before assessing intent:
  - Pivot on `powershell.file.script_block_id` to locate all related events.
  - Order events by `powershell.sequence` and confirm whether the observed sequence aligns with `powershell.total`.
  - Combine the fragments into a single script view to avoid misinterpreting partial content.

- Analyze `powershell.file.script_block_text` to understand capability and likely intent:
  - Identify which PSReflect artifacts are present (for example, `Add-Win32Type`, `New-InMemoryModule`, `psenum`, `DefineDynamicAssembly`, `DefineDynamicModule`, and `Runtime.InteropServices.DllImportAttribute`).
  - Determine whether the content is primarily a helper library (type/struct/enum definitions and import scaffolding) or includes immediate API calls or operational logic.
  - If `DllImportAttribute` is used, extract the referenced DLLs and imported function names from the script text and map them to likely objectives (for example, process/memory operations, token and privilege manipulation, registry or service interaction, or networking).
  - Capture distinctive identifiers from the script (function names, type names, imported API names, unique strings) to support scoping and hunting.

- Establish script origin and distribution:
  - If `file.path`/`file.name` are present, treat the script as file-backed and assess whether the location and filename align with approved tooling and change control.
  - If `file.path` is not present, consider that the script may have been executed interactively or delivered in-memory, and prioritize correlation with surrounding activity for the same `user.id` and `host.id`.

- Scope the activity across time, hosts, and users:
  - Search for additional script blocks on the same `host.id` and `user.id` around `@timestamp` to identify preceding staging activity and follow-on behavior.
  - Hunt across the environment for the same `file.path`/`file.name` and for distinctive strings extracted from `powershell.file.script_block_text` to identify other impacted hosts.
  - Pivot on `user.id` to determine whether the same account executed similar PSReflect content on other endpoints.

- Correlate with adjacent telemetry (if available) to confirm execution chain and impact:
  - Process telemetry: identify the PowerShell host process and its parent process to understand how the script was initiated (interactive, automated, or remote execution context).
  - Network telemetry: review DNS lookups and outbound connections near the alert time for evidence of staging, command-and-control, or lateral movement.
  - Endpoint changes: review file, service, scheduled task, and registry activity after the script execution to identify persistence, payload delivery, or privilege changes that align with the capabilities implied by the script text.
  - If Elastic Osquery response actions are available, collect DNS cache and service inventory to support scoping and to identify suspicious services or unsigned service binaries.

### False positive analysis

- False positives are possible in environments where administrators, developers, or internal tooling use PSReflect-style code to access native APIs from PowerShell.
- Validate legitimacy by confirming that:
  - The executing account and host are expected to run advanced PowerShell code (`user.id`, `user.name`, `host.id`, `host.name`).
  - The script source is known and controlled when `file.path`/`file.name` are present (for example, approved repositories, deployment paths, or administrative script locations).
  - The script content and its imported APIs are consistent with a documented operational need and do not align with common attacker objectives (for example, credential access, injection, or persistence).
- If the activity is recurring, baseline expected frequency and approved users/hosts to distinguish routine usage from anomalous execution.

### Response and remediation

- If malicious activity is confirmed or suspected:
  - Contain the affected host to prevent further execution and lateral movement, following your incident response procedures.
  - Preserve evidence: the fully reconstructed script (`powershell.file.script_block_id` with `powershell.sequence`/`powershell.total`), the raw script content (`powershell.file.script_block_text`), and any referenced file path details (`file.path`, `file.name`).
  - Use extracted identifiers (imported API names, helper function names, unique strings) to hunt for related activity across other hosts and users.
  - Investigate and remediate follow-on activity identified during correlation (persistence mechanisms, suspicious services, unexpected outbound connections, and any dropped or modified files).
  - If account compromise is suspected, reset credentials for the impacted user and review recent authentication activity to identify additional compromised assets.

- If the activity is confirmed benign:
  - Document the legitimate script/tool, expected hosts/users, and the operational purpose to speed up future triage.
  - Where appropriate, improve controls around advanced PowerShell usage (least privilege for scripting accounts, controlled script distribution, code review, and continued logging coverage).
