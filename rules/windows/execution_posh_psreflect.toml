### Investigating PowerShell PSReflect Script

PowerShell is one of the main tools in the belt of system administrators for automation, report routines, and other tasks.

PSReflect is a library that enables PowerShell to access win32 API functions in an uncomplicated way. It also helps to
create enums and structs easilyâ€”all without touching the disk.

Although this is an interesting project for every developer and admin out there, it is mainly used in the red team and
malware tooling for its capabilities.

Detecting the core implementation of PSReflect means detecting most of the tooling that uses Windows API through
PowerShell, enabling the defender to discover tools being dropped in the environment.

#### Possible investigation steps:
- Check for additional PowerShell logs that indicate that the script/command was run.
- Gather the script content that may be split into multiple script blocks, and identify its capabilities.
- If the action is suspicious for the user, check for any other activities done by the user in the last 48 hours.
- Look for additional alerts involving the host and the user.

### False Positive Analysis
- Verify whether the script content is malicious/harmful.

### Response and Remediation
- Immediate response steps should be taken to validate, investigate, and potentially contain the activity to prevent
further post-compromise behavior.

## Config
The 'PowerShell Script Block Logging' logging policy must be configured (Enable).

Steps to implement the logging policy with with Advanced Audit Configuration:
```
Computer Configuration > 
Administrative Templates > 
Windows PowerShell > 
Turn on PowerShell Script Block Logging (Enable)
```
Steps to implement the logging policy via registry:
```
reg add "hklm\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\ScriptBlockLogging" /v EnableScriptBlockLogging /t REG_DWORD /d 1
```
