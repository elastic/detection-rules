### Investigating Execution via TSClient Mountpoint

The TSClient mountpoint is a feature of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) that allows users to access local drives from a remote session. Adversaries can exploit this by executing malicious files from the shared mountpoint, facilitating lateral movement within a network. The detection rule identifies such activities by monitoring for process executions originating from the TSClient path, signaling potential unauthorized access attempts.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the alert details to confirm the process execution path matches the pattern "\\\\Device\\\\Mup\\\\tsclient\\\\*.exe" and verify the host operating system is Windows.
- Identify the user account associated with the RDP session and check for any unusual or unauthorized access patterns, such as logins from unexpected locations or at odd times.
- Examine the executed process's hash and compare it against known malicious hashes in threat intelligence databases to determine if the file is potentially harmful.
- Investigate the source system from which the RDP session originated to identify any signs of compromise or unauthorized access that could indicate lateral movement.
- Check for any additional suspicious activities on the target host, such as unexpected network connections or file modifications, that may correlate with the execution event.
- Review the security logs from data sources like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint or Sysmon for any related alerts or anomalies that could provide further context on the incident.

### False positive analysis

- Legitimate software updates or installations may trigger the rule if they are executed from a local drive mapped through TSClient. To manage this, create exceptions for known update processes or installation paths that are frequently used in your environment.
- IT administrative tasks performed via RDP sessions can also cause false positives. Identify and exclude specific administrative tools or scripts that are regularly executed from TSClient paths by trusted personnel.
- Automated backup or synchronization software that accesses local drives through RDP might be flagged. Review and whitelist these processes if they are part of routine operations.
- Development or testing activities involving remote execution of scripts or applications from TSClient can be mistaken for threats. Establish a list of approved development tools and paths to exclude from monitoring.
- Regularly review and update the list of exceptions to ensure that only verified and necessary exclusions are maintained, minimizing the risk of overlooking genuine threats.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further lateral movement and potential data exfiltration.
- Terminate any suspicious processes running from the TSClient path to halt any ongoing malicious activity.
- Conduct a thorough scan of the affected host using endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to identify and remove any malicious files or artifacts.
- Review and analyze RDP logs and session details to identify unauthorized access attempts and determine the source of the intrusion.
- Reset credentials for any accounts that were accessed or potentially compromised during the incident to prevent unauthorized access.
- Implement network segmentation to limit RDP access to only necessary systems and users, reducing the attack surface for similar threats.
- Escalate the incident to the security operations center (SOC) or incident response team for further investigation and to ensure comprehensive remediation efforts."""
