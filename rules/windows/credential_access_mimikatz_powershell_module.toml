### Investigating Potential Invoke-Mimikatz PowerShell Script

This alert identifies PowerShell script block content on a Windows host that contains strings commonly associated with Mimikatz or Invoke-Mimikatz activity. The matched content is consistent with attempts to access credentials from memory and/or enumerate and export certificates, which can enable rapid privilege escalation and lateral movement.

#### Key alert fields to review

- `user.name`, `user.domain`, `user.id`: Account execution context for correlation, prioritization, and scoping.
- `host.name`, `host.id`: Host execution context for correlation, prioritization, and scoping.
- `powershell.file.script_block_text`: Script block content that matched the detection logic.
- `powershell.file.script_block_id`, `powershell.sequence`, `powershell.total`: Script block metadata to pivot to other fragments or reconstruct full script content when split across multiple events.
- `file.path`, `file.directory`, `file.name`: File-origin context when the script block is sourced from an on-disk file.
- `powershell.file.script_block_length`: Script block length (size) context.

#### Possible investigation steps

- Establish basic context and prioritize:
  - Use `@timestamp` to define the initial investigation window and identify surrounding activity on the same `host.name` and for the same `user.name`.
  - Review `host.name` and `host.id` to determine whether the host is a high-value asset (e.g., administrative workstation, authentication infrastructure, file server) and whether it is expected to run high-risk administrative scripts.
  - Review `user.name`, `user.domain`, and `user.id` to determine whether the account is privileged, shared, or service-related, and whether its use on this host is expected.

- Analyze what the script block indicates:
  - Review `powershell.file.script_block_text` and categorize the intent based on the matched strings:
    - Credential dumping indicators (e.g., `sekurlsa::logonpasswords`, `DumpCreds`) suggest an attempt to extract authentication material from memory.
    - Certificate access indicators (e.g., `crypto::certificates`, `CERT_SYSTEM_STORE_LOCAL_MACHINE`, `DumpCerts`) suggest enumeration and potential export of certificates/keys.
  - Determine whether the content appears to be:
    - Tool staging (function or module definitions, large scripts) versus
    - Direct execution (explicit commands, parameters, or output handling).
    Use `powershell.file.script_block_length` as a quick signal for full-module loading versus a short invocation.
  - Extract and record any embedded scope details from `powershell.file.script_block_text` (usernames, domains, hostnames, file paths, share paths, or remote endpoints) to guide scoping.

- Reconstruct full script content when split across multiple events:
  - Pivot by `powershell.file.script_block_id` and order by `powershell.sequence` to rebuild the full script block.
  - Validate completeness using `powershell.total` (when present) and identify missing fragments that may require expanding the time window or searching for additional related script blocks.
  - After reconstruction, re-review the consolidated content for follow-on actions such as output to disk, remote targeting, or additional credential/certificate collection logic.

- Determine the likely script source and propagation risk:
  - If `file.path`, `file.directory`, or `file.name` are present, treat the activity as file-backed PowerShell content:
    - Identify whether the path and name align with known administrative scripts in your environment.
    - Look for other script blocks referencing the same `file.path` or `file.name` on the same `host.name` to understand reuse and execution frequency.
  - If file context is absent, treat the activity as inline/interactive or dynamically generated content and prioritize identifying the initiating execution chain using adjacent telemetry.

- Scope for additional related activity:
  - Search for other occurrences of the same `powershell.file.script_block_text` keywords across the environment, focusing on the same `user.name`/`user.id` and `host.name`/`host.id` first, then widening to other hosts and users.
  - Identify whether multiple distinct `powershell.file.script_block_id` values appear for the same user/host within a short period, which can indicate iterative testing, staging, or repeated execution.

- Correlate with adjacent telemetry in the same time window (if available in your environment):
  - Process activity: identify the PowerShell host process and its parent process on `host.name` around `@timestamp` to determine whether execution was interactive, scheduled, or remotely initiated.
  - File activity: look for evidence of exported data (credential output, dumps, certificate files) and for newly created or modified scripts consistent with the `file.path` context or references found in `powershell.file.script_block_text`.
  - Network activity: review outbound and internal connections from `host.name` around `@timestamp`, especially if the script text references remote systems or suggests staging/exfiltration behavior.
  - Authentication activity: review successful and failed authentications involving `user.name` and other accounts referenced in the script text after the alert time to identify potential credential reuse or lateral movement.

### False positive analysis

- Authorized security testing and adversary simulation can legitimately execute Mimikatz-related tooling. Validate with the owning team, documented approval, and expected targets and timing.
- Training, lab, or malware analysis environments may execute or store Mimikatz-related scripts for educational purposes. Confirm the host purpose and ensure activity is confined to approved non-production systems.
- Some defensive, auditing, or instructional PowerShell content may include these strings as examples or test cases. Confirm the surrounding script context in `powershell.file.script_block_text` and whether the content represents active execution versus reference text. Unexpected use on production endpoints or by standard users should be treated as suspicious.

### Response and remediation

- If activity is confirmed or strongly suspected malicious:
  - Contain the affected host (`host.name`) according to your incident response process to limit further credential access and lateral movement.
  - Preserve evidence:
    - Save the full reconstructed script content (all fragments associated with `powershell.file.script_block_id`) and retain relevant logs around `@timestamp`.
    - If `file.path` is present, preserve the referenced script file and any related artifacts identified during triage.
  - Assume credential exposure may have occurred when credential dumping indicators are present:
    - Initiate credential resets for the involved `user.name` and any other accounts referenced in `powershell.file.script_block_text`, prioritizing privileged and service accounts.
    - Review for follow-on authentications and lateral movement originating from `host.name`.
  - If certificate access indicators are present:
    - Identify potentially impacted certificates and keys, restrict use as appropriate, and coordinate revocation and re-issuance based on your PKI and incident response procedures.
  - Expand hunting:
    - Search for the same keywords and related script blocks across other hosts and users to determine spread and identify additional affected systems.

- If activity is determined to be authorized:
  - Document the business justification, responsible parties, and approved scope (hosts and users).
  - Apply preventive controls to reduce risk of misuse, such as limiting where high-risk tools can run, restricting PowerShell usage to approved accounts and hosts, and enhancing monitoring for future occurrences.
