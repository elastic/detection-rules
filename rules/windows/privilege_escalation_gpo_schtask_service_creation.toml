### Investigating Creation or Modification of a new GPO Scheduled Task or Service

Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are crucial for centralized management in Windows environments, allowing administrators to configure settings across domain-joined machines. Adversaries with domain admin rights can exploit GPOs to create or modify scheduled tasks or services, deploying malicious payloads network-wide. The detection rule identifies such activities by monitoring specific file changes in GPO paths, excluding legitimate system processes, thus highlighting potential abuse for privilege escalation or persistence.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the file path and name to confirm if the changes were made to "ScheduledTasks.xml" or "Services.xml" within the specified GPO paths, as these are indicative of potential unauthorized modifications.
- Check the process that initiated the file change, ensuring it is not "C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\dfsrs.exe", which is excluded as a legitimate system process.
- Investigate the user account associated with the file modification event to determine if it has domain admin rights and assess if the activity aligns with their typical behavior or role.
- Examine recent changes in the GPO settings to identify any new or altered scheduled tasks or services that could be used for malicious purposes.
- Correlate the event with other security logs or alerts from data sources like Elastic Endgame, Sysmon, or Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to identify any related suspicious activities or patterns.
- Assess the impact by identifying which domain-joined machines are affected by the GPO changes and determine if any unauthorized tasks or services have been executed.

### False positive analysis

- Legitimate administrative changes to GPOs can trigger alerts. Regularly review and document scheduled administrative tasks to differentiate between expected and unexpected changes.
- Automated system management tools may modify GPO scheduled tasks or services as part of routine operations. Identify these tools and create exceptions for their processes to reduce noise.
- Updates or patches from Microsoft or other trusted vendors might alter GPO settings. Monitor update schedules and correlate changes with known update activities to verify legitimacy.
- Internal IT scripts or processes that manage GPOs for configuration consistency can cause false positives. Ensure these scripts are well-documented and consider excluding their specific actions from monitoring.
- Temporary changes made by IT staff for troubleshooting or testing purposes can be mistaken for malicious activity. Implement a change management process to log and approve such activities, allowing for easy exclusion from alerts.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further spread of any malicious payloads deployed via the modified GPO scheduled tasks or services.
- Revoke domain admin privileges from any accounts that are suspected of being compromised to prevent further unauthorized modifications to GPOs.
- Conduct a thorough review of the modified ScheduledTasks.xml and Services.xml files to identify any unauthorized or malicious entries, and revert them to their previous legitimate state.
- Utilize endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to scan for and remove any malicious payloads that may have been executed on domain-joined machines as a result of the GPO modifications.
- Notify the security operations center (SOC) and escalate the incident to the incident response team for further investigation and to determine the scope of the compromise.
- Implement additional monitoring on GPO paths and domain admin activities to detect any further unauthorized changes or suspicious behavior.
- Review and strengthen access controls and auditing policies for GPO management to prevent unauthorized modifications in the future."""
