### Investigating Service Command Lateral Movement

The Service Control Manager in Windows allows for the management of services, which are crucial for system operations. Adversaries exploit this by using `sc.exe` to manipulate services on remote systems, facilitating lateral movement. The detection rule identifies suspicious `sc.exe` usage by monitoring for service-related commands targeting remote hosts, which may indicate unauthorized access attempts. This rule helps differentiate between legitimate administrative actions and potential threats.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the process details to confirm the use of sc.exe, focusing on the process.entity_id and process.args fields to understand the specific service-related actions attempted.
- Examine the network activity associated with the sc.exe process, particularly the destination.ip field, to identify the remote host targeted by the command and assess if it is a legitimate administrative target.
- Check the event logs on the remote host for any corresponding service creation, modification, or start events to verify if the actions were successfully executed and to gather additional context.
- Investigate the user account associated with the sc.exe process to determine if it has the necessary permissions for such actions and if the account usage aligns with expected behavior.
- Correlate the alert with other recent alerts or logs involving the same process.entity_id or destination.ip to identify any patterns or additional suspicious activities that may indicate a broader attack campaign.

### False positive analysis

- Routine administrative tasks using sc.exe on remote systems can trigger false positives. Identify and document regular maintenance schedules and responsible personnel to differentiate these from potential threats.
- Automated scripts or management tools that use sc.exe for legitimate service management may cause alerts. Review and whitelist these scripts or tools by their process entity IDs to reduce noise.
- Internal IT operations often involve creating or modifying services remotely. Establish a baseline of normal activity patterns and exclude these from alerts by setting exceptions for known IP addresses or user accounts.
- Software deployment processes that involve service configuration changes can be mistaken for lateral movement. Coordinate with software deployment teams to understand their processes and exclude these activities from detection.
- Regularly review and update the exclusion list to ensure it reflects current operational practices and does not inadvertently allow malicious activity.

### Response and remediation

- Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further lateral movement and unauthorized access to other systems.
- Terminate any suspicious `sc.exe` processes identified on the affected system to halt any ongoing malicious activity.
- Review and reset credentials for any accounts that were used in the suspicious `sc.exe` activity to prevent unauthorized access.
- Conduct a thorough examination of the affected system for any additional signs of compromise, such as unauthorized services or changes to existing services.
- Restore the affected system from a known good backup if any malicious modifications or persistent threats are detected.
- Implement network segmentation to limit the ability of adversaries to move laterally across the network in the future.
- Escalate the incident to the security operations center (SOC) or incident response team for further investigation and to determine if additional systems are affected."""
