### Investigating PowerShell Invoke-NinjaCopy script

This rule identifies PowerShell script block content referencing `Invoke-NinjaCopy` or related `Stealth*` helper functions. These functions are commonly used to perform direct volume file reads that can bypass normal file locking and access controls, enabling copies of sensitive credential stores (for example, `NTDS.dit` or registry hives like `SAM`, `SYSTEM`, and `SECURITY`). The presence of these strings can represent tool staging (definition/import) or active execution, so focus on determining intent, targeted artifacts, output locations, and surrounding activity.

#### Key alert fields to review

- `user.name`, `user.domain`, `user.id`: Account execution context for correlation, prioritization, and scoping.
- `host.name`, `host.id`: Host execution context for correlation, prioritization, and scoping.
- `powershell.file.script_block_text`: Script block content that matched the detection logic.
- `powershell.file.script_block_id`, `powershell.sequence`, `powershell.total`: Script block metadata to pivot to other fragments or reconstruct full script content when split across multiple events.
- `file.path`, `file.directory`, `file.name`: File-origin context when the script block is sourced from an on-disk file.
- `powershell.file.script_block_length`: Script block length (size) context.

#### Possible investigation steps

- Triage the alert context:
  - Identify the affected `host.name` / `host.id` and the account (`user.name`, `user.domain`, `user.id`).
  - Determine whether the host is expected to store credential material (for example, a directory services server) and whether the user is expected to perform privileged maintenance on it.
  - Use the alert time (`@timestamp`) to define an initial correlation window and expand as needed.

- Analyze `powershell.file.script_block_text` to understand what was staged or executed:
  - Determine whether the content is primarily function definitions/module code (tool load) or includes direct invocation of `Invoke-NinjaCopy` and `Stealth*` functions.
  - Extract any referenced source artifacts (for example, `NTDS.dit` or registry hives) and any destination/output file names, directories, or remote paths.
  - Look for indicators of direct volume access, such as device/volume path handling, low-level file handle usage, delegates, or logic intended to bypass normal file locking.
  - Identify follow-on logic that would support collection and handling (copy loops, chunking, archiving, encoding, renaming, or cleanup).

- Use script block metadata to reconstruct full content when logged in multiple parts:
  - Pivot on `powershell.file.script_block_id` for the same `host.id`.
  - Order fragments by `powershell.sequence` and confirm the final part count matches `powershell.total`.
  - If parts are missing, treat the content as incomplete and continue scoping for additional fragments.
  - Preserve the reconstructed content and the original fragment events for case evidence.

- Determine script provenance when file context is present:
  - Review `file.path` / `file.name` (and `file.directory` if populated) to identify where the script was executed from.
  - Treat execution from user-writable or temporary locations as higher risk, and scope for other executions originating from the same path or directory on the host.
  - If file context is not present, consider interactive execution or remote delivery and expand scoping to other script blocks from the same `host.id` and `user.id` around the alert time.

- Scope for related PowerShell activity on the endpoint:
  - Review additional Script Block Logging events for the same `host.id` and `user.id` around the alert time to identify staging, retries, and post-collection actions.
  - Use `powershell.file.script_block_length` to prioritize larger blocks that may contain full tooling, embedded functions, or post-processing logic.
  - Prioritize script blocks that reference the same artifact names or output locations observed in the matched content.

- Assess prevalence across the environment:
  - Search for the same keywords within `powershell.file.script_block_text` (for example, `Invoke-NinjaCopy` and `StealthOpenFile`) across other hosts to identify broader deployment.
  - If `file.path` or `file.name` is present, use it to identify reuse of the same script file across multiple hosts or users.

- Correlate with adjacent telemetry (if available) using `host.name`, `host.id`, `user.id`, and the alert time:
  - Process activity to identify the PowerShell host process and the parent/source that initiated it, and whether execution aligns with expected administrative workflows.
  - File activity to confirm whether copies of targeted artifacts were created, where they were written, and whether they were later archived or moved.
  - Network activity to identify outbound transfers or remote access shortly after script execution.
  - Authentication activity to identify suspicious logons, privilege use, or lateral movement following potential credential material collection.

- Determine impact:
  - If the script indicates attempted access to directory services database files or registry hives, treat this as potential credential exposure until corroborating telemetry shows otherwise and respond accordingly.

### False positive analysis

- Approved security testing, adversary emulation, or controlled red team activity that includes NinjaCopy-derived code.
- Authorized incident response, forensic acquisition, or recovery workflows that require copying locked system files.
- Administrative tooling that embeds similar helper functions for troubleshooting or backup operations (uncommon); validate ownership, expected hosts, and change control.

### Response and remediation

- If the activity is not expected or cannot be attributed to an approved task:
  - Isolate the affected host to prevent additional collection, staging, or lateral movement.
  - Take immediate steps to prevent further use of the implicated account (`user.id`) until legitimacy is confirmed.

- Preserve and collect evidence:
  - Save the full `powershell.file.script_block_text` and reconstruct missing fragments using `powershell.file.script_block_id`, `powershell.sequence`, and `powershell.total` where applicable.
  - Record `@timestamp`, `host.name`, `host.id`, `user.name`, `user.domain`, `user.id`, and any available `file.path` / `file.name` context.
  - Identify any destination/output locations referenced in the script content and preserve related artifacts (copied files, archives, temporary staging).

- Assess credential exposure and potential follow-on activity:
  - Use available endpoint telemetry to determine whether credential stores were successfully copied or staged.
  - If credential stores may have been accessed or copied, follow your credential containment process and prioritize rotation of impacted and privileged credentials.

- Eradicate and scope:
  - Remove unauthorized scripts and supporting artifacts identified from `file.path` / `file.name` and from any output locations referenced in the script.
  - Hunt for additional NinjaCopy-related script blocks across endpoints and for subsequent suspicious authentication activity associated with the same user and host context.

- Recover and harden:
  - Restore affected systems as needed and validate that no persistence remains.
  - Reduce recurrence by tightening administrative scripting governance for PowerShell (least privilege, controlled script deployment locations, and application control where feasible) and by restricting access to systems that store credential material.
