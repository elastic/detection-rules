### Investigating Enumeration of Privileged Local Groups Membership

After a successful initial compromise, attackers may try to gain situational awareness of the environment to plan their
next steps. This can happen by running commands to enumerate network resources, users, connections, files, and security
software installed.

This rule looks for the enumeration of privileged local groups membership by suspicious processes, excluding known legit
utilities and programs installed. This information can be used by attackers to decide the next steps of the attack, such
as mapping targets for credential compromise and other post-exploitation activities.

#### Possible investigation steps

- Identify the process, host and user involved on the event.
- Investigate the process execution chain (parent process tree).
- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.
- Investigate abnormal behaviors done using the account, such as commands executed, startup folder modifications, and
network connections.
- Retrieve the process executable and determine if it is malicious:
  - Check if the file belongs to the operating system or has a valid digital signature.
  - Use a private sandboxed malware analysis system to perform analysis.
    - Observe and collect information about the following activities:
      - Attempts to contact external domains and addresses.
      - File and registry access, modification, and creation activities.
      - Service creation and launch activities.
      - Scheduled tasks creation.

### False positive analysis

- Discovery activities themselves are not inherently malicious if occurring in isolation. As long as the analyst did not
identify any suspicious activity related to the user or host, such alerts can be dismissed.
- If this activity is expected and noisy in your environment, consider adding exceptions â€” preferably with a combination
of user and command line conditions.

### Response and remediation

- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.
- Quarantine the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
- Reset passwords for the user account and other potentially compromised accounts (email, services, CRMs, etc.).
- Determine the initial infection vector.

## Config

The 'Audit Security Group Management' audit policy must be configured (Success).
Steps to implement the logging policy with with Advanced Audit Configuration:

```
Computer Configuration > 
Policies > 
Windows Settings > 
Security Settings > 
Advanced Audit Policies Configuration > 
Audit Policies > 
Account Management >
Audit Security Group Management (Success)
```

Microsoft introduced the event used in this detection rule on Windows 10/2016 and later operating systems.

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.
