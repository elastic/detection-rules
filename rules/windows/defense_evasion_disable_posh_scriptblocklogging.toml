### Investigating PowerShell Script Block Logging Disabled

This alert indicates a registry modification that set `EnableScriptBlockLogging` to a disabled value (`registry.data.strings` of `0` or `0x00000000`). Disabling Script Block Logging reduces visibility into PowerShell execution and is commonly used to evade detection, especially when followed by script-driven activity.

#### Key alert fields to review

- `process.executable`: The process responsible for modifying the registry value.
- `registry.value`: The registry value name that was changed (`EnableScriptBlockLogging`).
- `registry.data.strings`: The new data indicating the setting was disabled.
- `registry.path`: The full registry path of the modified value.
- `user.name`, `user.domain`, `user.id`: Account execution context for correlation, prioritization, and scoping.
- `host.name`, `host.id`: Host execution context for correlation, prioritization, and scoping.

#### Possible investigation steps

- Establish the affected endpoint and time window:
  - Use `host.name`, `host.id`, and `@timestamp` to identify the impacted endpoint and define a review window (include activity immediately before and after the change).
  - Prioritize based on endpoint role and criticality (for example, servers and admin workstations).

- Validate the registry change and its scope:
  - Review `registry.path`, `registry.value`, and `registry.data.strings` to confirm the setting was disabled and to understand where it was applied.
  - Compare `registry.path` to common policy locations for Script Block Logging (for example, `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\ScriptBlockLogging\\EnableScriptBlockLogging`).
  - Determine whether the change is likely machine-wide or user-scoped based on the hive reflected in `registry.path`, and assess the blast radius accordingly.
  - Check for repeated changes (toggling) to the same `registry.path` and `registry.value` around the alert time, which can indicate attempted evasion or policy enforcement conflicts.

- Identify the modifying process and execution context:
  - Review `process.executable` for legitimacy (expected binary name, expected install path) and whether it typically performs configuration changes.
  - Pivoting using `process.entity_id`, review `process.command_line` to understand how the value was set and whether the command line suggests interactive administration, scripts, or automation.
  - Using nearby endpoint process telemetry on the same host, reconstruct the process tree to identify the initiating process (parent) and any immediate follow-on execution that may have benefited from reduced PowerShell logging.

- Assess the user context and authorization:
  - Review `user.name`, `user.domain`, and `user.id` to determine whether the account is expected to manage logging or policy settings on this endpoint.
  - If the change is attributed to a service or system context, identify the associated service, scheduled activity, or management workflow that could have performed the modification.
  - Scope the user across other hosts for similar activity during the same window to identify potential credential misuse.

- Hunt for related activity that may be masked by reduced logging:
  - Review host activity immediately before the change for suspicious behavior that could explain the need to disable Script Block Logging (initial access, privilege escalation, or tool staging).
  - Review host activity after the change for suspicious process launches, script interpreter activity, persistence attempts, credential access behavior, or lateral movement indicators.
  - Review network activity from the host around the change for connections consistent with payload retrieval, remote access, or command and control.
  - Review other registry changes around the same time that may further impair visibility or weaken defenses.

- Scope and impact assessment across the environment:
  - Search for other instances where `registry.value` is `EnableScriptBlockLogging` and `registry.data.strings` indicates a disabled state to determine whether this is isolated or widespread.
  - Pivot on `process.executable` and `user.id` to identify other endpoints where the same process or account modified this setting.
  - Identify whether the setting was later restored on the same host by looking for subsequent changes to the same `registry.path` and `registry.value`.

### False positive analysis

- Authorized policy, baseline, or hardening changes that intentionally modify PowerShell logging settings, supported by change records and consistent execution by expected accounts and tooling.
- Provisioning or imaging workflows where configuration changes occur during early host lifecycle stages and are consistent across a known deployment batch.
- Short-lived administrative troubleshooting where the setting is temporarily changed and promptly restored, with supporting documentation.

### Response and remediation

- If the change is unexpected or suspicious:
  - Treat as potential defense evasion and escalate according to incident response procedures.
  - Contain the endpoint if there are indicators of follow-on malicious activity in the surrounding timeframe.
  - Preserve evidence related to the change, including `process.executable`, `process.command_line`, user context, and any correlated endpoint telemetry.

- Restore and enforce PowerShell visibility:
  - Re-enable Script Block Logging using approved administrative processes and verify the setting persists through policy enforcement.
  - Monitor for repeated attempts to disable Script Block Logging, especially from the same user or originating process.

- Remediate root cause and reduce recurrence:
  - Identify and remove unauthorized tooling or persistence associated with the modifying process.
  - Investigate potential account compromise for the associated user and take appropriate actions (credential reset and access review), prioritizing privileged accounts.
  - Hunt for additional endpoints impacted by the same user or process and remediate as needed.
  - Apply least-privilege controls to limit who can modify logging-related registry settings and improve alerting for additional defense impairment behaviors observed during the investigation window.
