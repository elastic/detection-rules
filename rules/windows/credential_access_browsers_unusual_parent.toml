### Investigating Browser Process Spawned from an Unusual Parent

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the process execution details to confirm that a web browser process (e.g., chrome.exe, msedge.exe, firefox.exe) has an unusual or suspicious parent process. Focus on the process.parent.name, process.name, and process.args fields.
- Examine the command line arguments for signs of remote debugging flags (e.g., --remote-debugging-port, --remote-debugging-pipe) or injected DLLs that could indicate attempts to hijack browser sessions.
- Check whether the parent process is a scripting host (e.g., wscript.exe, cscript.exe), system utility, or unexpected binary (e.g., cmd.exe, rundll32.exe, powershell.exe) rather than the legitimate browser updater or system launcher.
- Investigate if the suspicious parent process has a known reputation or hash linked to malware or credential-stealing tools by correlating with threat intelligence sources.
- Look for additional related processes spawned by the browser that might indicate malicious activity, such as network connections to unusual external IPs or data exfiltration attempts.
- Review authentication logs to identify if any credential theft attempts occurred shortly after the suspicious browser activity, focusing on abnormal logins, failed authentications, or credential access patterns.
- Cross-reference with endpoint telemetry (e.g., Defender for Endpoint, Sysmon) to identify whether this event is part of a broader intrusion attempt involving code injection or persistence mechanisms.

### False positive analysis

- Certain enterprise management or testing tools may launch browsers with remote debugging enabled for automation purposes. Identify and document such legitimate tools and processes.
- Development environments may use browser remote debugging features during legitimate software testing. Exclude known dev/test machines or users from triggering alerts in production environments.
- Security testing frameworks or internal red team activities may use similar techniques. Coordinate with authorized security teams to whitelist scheduled exercises.
- Browser extensions or third-party plugins could sometimes spawn processes that appear unusual. Validate if the behavior aligns with known, legitimate extensions.
- Automated IT scripts or orchestration tools might start browsers in debugging mode for monitoring purposes. Whitelist these cases based on process path, signature, or command-line arguments.

### Response and remediation

- Isolate the affected endpoint from the network to prevent potential credential theft or data exfiltration.
- Terminate any suspicious processes identified in the alert, including both the browser and its anomalous parent process.
- Collect forensic artifacts (process memory, browser profiles, injected modules) for further investigation and potential IOCs.
- Reset credentials for accounts that may have been exposed through the compromised browser session.
- Deploy updated endpoint protection signatures and enable stricter application control policies to prevent browsers from being launched by untrusted processes.
- Enhance monitoring for browser processes launched with debugging flags or code injection indicators across the environment.
- Escalate to the SOC or IR team to determine whether this event is part of a larger credential theft campaign or linked to other lateral movement activity."""
