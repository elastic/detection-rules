Adversaries may leverage unquoted service path vulnerabilities to escalate privileges. By placing an executable in a
higher-level directory within the path of an unquoted service executable, Windows will natively launch this executable
from its defined path variable instead of the benign one in a deeper directory, thus leading to code execution.
