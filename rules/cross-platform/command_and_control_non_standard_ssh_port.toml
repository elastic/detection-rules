Identifies potentially malicious processes communicating via a port paring typically not associated with SSH. For
example, SSH over port 2200 or port 2222 as opposed to the traditional port 22. Adversaries may make changes to the
standard port a protocol uses to bypass filtering or muddle analysis/parsing of network data.

    SSH over ports apart from the traditional port 22 is highly uncommon. This rule alerts the usage of the such
    uncommon ports by the ssh service. Tuning is needed to have higher confidence. If this activity is expected and
    noisy in your environment, consider adding exceptions â€” preferably with a combination whitelisted ports for such
    legitimate ssh activities.
