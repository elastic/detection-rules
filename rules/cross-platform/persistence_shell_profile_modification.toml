Both ~/.bash_profile and ~/.bashrc are files containing shell commands that are run when Bash is invoked. These files
are executed in a user's context, either interactively or non-interactively, when a user logs in so that their
environment is set correctly. Adversaries may abuse this to establish persistence by executing malicious content
triggered by a userâ€™s shell.
