This rule identifies Zoom meetings that are created without a passcode. Meetings without a passcode are susceptible to
Zoombombing. Zoombombing is carried out by taking advantage of Zoom sessions that are not protected with a passcode.
Zoombombing refers to the unwanted, disruptive intrusion, generally by Internet trolls and hackers, into a video
conference call. In a typical Zoombombing incident, a teleconferencing session is hijacked by the insertion of material
that is lewd, obscene, racist, or antisemitic in nature, typically resulting of the shutdown of the session.

### Investigating Zoom Meeting with no Passcode

Zoom meetings without passcodes are vulnerable to unauthorized access, known as Zoombombing, where intruders disrupt sessions with inappropriate content. Adversaries exploit this by targeting unprotected meetings, leading to potential data breaches or session shutdowns. The detection rule identifies such meetings by monitoring Zoom event logs for creation events lacking a passcode, helping to mitigate these security risks.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the alert details to confirm the presence of the `event.type:creation` and `event.action:meeting.created` fields, ensuring the alert is triggered by a meeting creation event.
- Check the `event.module:zoom` and `event.dataset:zoom.webhook` fields to verify the event source and ensure it is related to Zoom's webhook data.
- Investigate the `zoom.meeting.password` field to confirm the absence of a passcode, which is the primary trigger for this alert.
- Identify the user or account associated with the meeting creation by examining the user-related fields in the event logs.
- Cross-reference the meeting ID with other logs to determine if there were any unauthorized access attempts or unusual activities associated with the meeting.
- Use Osquery to gather additional context on the host machine from which the meeting was created. Example query: `SELECT * FROM processes WHERE name LIKE '%zoom%' AND start_time > (SELECT datetime('now', '-1 hour'));` to identify recent Zoom processes.
- Analyze network logs to detect any suspicious IP addresses or connections that may have interacted with the meeting link.
- Review historical data for patterns of meetings created without passcodes by the same user or account to identify potential negligence or malicious intent.
- Check for any related alerts or incidents involving the same user or meeting ID to assess if this is part of a larger security issue.
- Document findings and gather evidence from the investigation to support further analysis or escalation if necessary.

### False positive analysis

- Internal meetings intentionally set without passcodes for ease of access can trigger false positives. These are often non-threatening if the meeting links are shared only within a trusted network.
- Educational institutions may host open sessions for public webinars or lectures, which might be flagged by the rule. These sessions are typically non-threatening if they are monitored and managed by the host.
- Organizations conducting public events or community outreach programs might create meetings without passcodes to encourage participation. These should be reviewed to ensure they are not mistakenly flagged as threats.
- To manage these false positives, users can create exceptions for specific meeting hosts or recurring meeting IDs that are known to be safe and intentionally set without passcodes.
- Implementing a whitelist of trusted domains or email addresses that frequently create meetings without passcodes can help reduce unnecessary alerts.
- Regularly review and update the list of exceptions to ensure it aligns with current organizational practices and security policies.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately terminate any ongoing Zoom meetings identified without a passcode to prevent further unauthorized access or disruption.
- Notify the meeting host and relevant stakeholders about the security incident and advise them to reschedule the meeting with appropriate security measures, such as enabling a passcode or waiting room.
- Review Zoom account settings to ensure that passcodes are required for all future meetings by default and consider enabling additional security features like waiting rooms or authentication.
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the event logs to identify any unauthorized access or data breaches that may have occurred during the unprotected meeting.
- Escalate the incident to the IT security team for further analysis and to determine if any sensitive information was compromised, leveraging the MITRE ATT&CK framework to understand potential exploitation methods.
- Implement enhanced logging policies to capture detailed Zoom meeting events, including participant join and leave times, to aid in future investigations.
- Integrate Zoom with security information and event management (SIEM) systems to automate the detection and alerting of meetings created without passcodes.
- Educate users on the importance of securing virtual meetings and provide training on how to configure Zoom settings to prevent Zoombombing.
- Restore any affected systems or services to their operational state by applying necessary security patches and updates to prevent similar incidents.
- Conduct a post-incident review to identify gaps in the current security posture and implement hardening measures, such as enforcing multi-factor authentication for all Zoom accounts."""
