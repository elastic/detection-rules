### Investigating Alerts From Multiple Integrations by Source Address

The detection rule uses alert data to determine when multiple alerts from different integrations involving the same source.ip are triggered.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the alert details to identify the specific host involved and the different modules and rules that triggered the alert.
- Examine the timeline of the alerts to understand the sequence of events and determine if there is a pattern or progression in the tactics used.
- Correlate the alert data with other logs and telemetry from the host, such as process creation, network connections, and file modifications, to gather additional context.
- Investigate any known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations on the host that could have been exploited by the adversary.
- Check for any indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with the alerts, such as suspicious IP addresses, domains, or file hashes, and search for these across the network.
- Assess the impact and scope of the potential compromise by determining if other hosts or systems have similar alerts or related activity.

### False positive analysis

- Alerts from routine administrative tasks may trigger multiple tactics. Review and exclude known benign activities such as scheduled software updates or system maintenance.
- Security tools running on the host might generate alerts across different tactics. Identify and exclude alerts from trusted security applications to reduce noise.
- Automated scripts or batch processes can mimic adversarial behavior. Analyze and whitelist these processes if they are verified as non-threatening.
- Frequent alerts from development or testing environments can be misleading. Consider excluding these environments from the rule or applying a different risk score.
- User behavior anomalies, such as accessing multiple systems or applications, might trigger alerts. Implement user behavior baselines to differentiate between normal and suspicious activities.

### Response and remediation

- Isolate the affected host from the network immediately to prevent further lateral movement by the adversary.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the host to identify the specific vulnerabilities exploited and gather evidence of the attack phases involved.
- Remove any identified malicious software or unauthorized access tools from the host, ensuring all persistence mechanisms are eradicated.
- Apply security patches and updates to the host to address any exploited vulnerabilities and prevent similar attacks.
- Restore the host from a known good backup if necessary, ensuring that the backup is free from compromise.
- Monitor the host and network for any signs of re-infection or further suspicious activity, using enhanced logging and alerting based on the identified attack patterns.
- Escalate the incident to the appropriate internal or external cybersecurity teams for further investigation and potential legal action if the attack is part of a larger campaign."""
