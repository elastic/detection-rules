This rule detects unusual spikes in error logs from web servers, which may indicate reconnaissance activities such
as vulnerability scanning or fuzzing attempts by adversaries. These activities often generate a high volume of error
responses as they probe for weaknesses in web applications. Error response codes may potentially indicate server-side
issues that could be exploited.
