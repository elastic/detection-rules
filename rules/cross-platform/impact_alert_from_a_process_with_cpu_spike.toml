This rule requires host CPU metrics collected via the Elastic Agent **System** integration.

### System Metrics Integration Setup
The System integration collects host-level metrics such as CPU usage, load, memory, and process statistics and sends them to Elasticsearch using Elastic Agent.

#### Prerequisite Requirements:
- Elastic Agent managed by Fleet
- A Fleet Server configured and reachable
  Refer to the Fleet Server setup guide:
  https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-server.html

#### The following steps should be executed in order to enable CPU metrics collection:
- Go to the Kibana home page and click **Add integrations**.
- In the search bar, enter **System** and select the **System** integration.
- Click **Add System**.
- Configure an integration name and optionally add a description.
- Under **Metrics**, ensure the following datasets are enabled:
  - `system.cpu`
  - `system.load` (optional but recommended)
  - `system.process` (optional, if process-level CPU is required)
- Review optional and advanced settings as needed.
- Add the integration to an existing agent policy or create a new agent policy.
- Deploy the Elastic Agent to the hosts from which CPU metrics should be collected.
- Click **Save and Continue** to finalize the setup.

#### Validation
After deployment, verify CPU metrics ingestion by confirming the presence of documents in:
- `metrics-system.cpu-*`
- `metrics-system.load-*` (if enabled)

For more details on the System integration and available metrics, refer to the documentation:
https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/system

### Investigating Detection Alert on a Process Exhibiting CPU Spike

This rule identifies processes that both triggered a security alert and exhibited unusually high CPU utilization on the
same host and process ID within a short time window. This combination may indicate malicious execution, resource abuse, or
post-compromise activity.

### Possible investigation steps
- Review the correlated alert(s) to understand why the process was flagged by Elastic Defend.
- Examine the process name, command line, and SHA-256 hash to determine whether the process is expected or known to be malicious.
- Validate the observed CPU usage and duration to determine whether the spike is abnormal for this process and host.
- Check for related process activity such as parent/child processes, suspicious process spawning, or privilege escalation attempts.
- Review additional host telemetry including:
  - Network connections initiated by the process
  - File creation or modification events
  - Persistence mechanisms (services, scheduled tasks, registry keys)
- Determine whether similar activity is observed on other hosts, which may indicate a broader compromise.

### False positive analysis
- Legitimate high-CPU processes such as software updates, backup agents, security scans, or system maintenance tasks.
- Resource-intensive but benign applications (e.g., compilers, video encoding, data processing jobs).
- Security tools or monitoring agents temporarily consuming high CPU.

### Response and remediation
- If malicious activity is confirmed, isolate the affected host to prevent further impact.
- Terminate the offending process if safe to do so.
- Remove any identified malicious binaries or artifacts and eliminate persistence mechanisms.
- Apply relevant patches or configuration changes to remediate the root cause.
- Monitor the environment for recurrence of similar high-CPU processes combined with security alerts.
- Escalate the incident if multiple hosts or indicators suggest coordinated or widespread activity."""
