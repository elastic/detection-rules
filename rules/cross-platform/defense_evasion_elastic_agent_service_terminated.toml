Identifies the Elastic endpoint agent has stopped and is no longer running on the host. Adversaries may attempt to
disable security monitoring tools in an attempt to evade detection or prevention capabilities during an intrusion. This

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.
