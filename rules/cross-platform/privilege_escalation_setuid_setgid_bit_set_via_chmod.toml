description = """
An adversary may add the setuid or setgid bit to a file or directory in order to run a file with the privileges of the
owning user or group. An adversary can take advantage of this to either do a shell escape or exploit a vulnerability in
an application with the setuid or setgid bit to get code running in a different userâ€™s context. Additionally,
adversaries can use this mechanism on their own malware to make sure they're able to execute in elevated contexts in the
future.
