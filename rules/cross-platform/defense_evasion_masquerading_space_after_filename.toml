This rules identifies a process created from an executable with a space appended to the end of the filename. This may
indicate an attempt to masquerade a malicious file as benign to gain user execution. When a space is added to the end of
certain files, the OS will execute the file according to it's true filetype instead of it's extension. Adversaries can
hide a program's true filetype by changing the extension of the file. They can then add a space to the end of the name
so that the OS automatically executes the file when it's double-clicked.

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.
