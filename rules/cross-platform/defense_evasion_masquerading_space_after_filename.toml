This rules identifies a process created from an executable with a space appended to the end of the filename. This may
indicate an attempt to masquerade a malicious file as benign to gain user execution. When a space is added to the end of
certain files, the OS will execute the file according to it's true filetype instead of it's extension. Adversaries can
hide a program's true filetype by changing the extension of the file. They can then add a space to the end of the name
so that the OS automatically executes the file when it's double-clicked.

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2,
events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until version 8.2.
Hence for this rule to work effectively, users will need to add a custom ingest pipeline to populate
`event.ingested` to @timestamp.
For more details on adding a custom ingest pipeline refer - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/data-streams-pipeline-tutorial.html
