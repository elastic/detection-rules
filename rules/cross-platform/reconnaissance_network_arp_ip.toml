This rule detects when specific networking-related commands are executed on an endpoint. It triggers when either the ARP
command (used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses within a local network) is initiated or when the IP command with
arguments related to neighbors (providing similar functionality on Linux systems) is started. Such commands can be
normal in administrative contexts, but in sensitive environments or from unexpected sources, they might indicate
potential malicious activity or unauthorized network exploration.
