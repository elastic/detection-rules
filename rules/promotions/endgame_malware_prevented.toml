This rule is configured to generate more **Max alerts per run** than the default 1000 alerts per run set for all rules. This is to ensure that it captures as many alerts as possible.

**IMPORTANT:** The rule's **Max alerts per run** setting can be superseded by the `xpack.alerting.rules.run.alerts.max` Kibana config setting, which determines the maximum alerts generated by _any_ rule in the Kibana alerting framework. For example, if `xpack.alerting.rules.run.alerts.max` is set to 1000, this rule will still generate no more than 1000 alerts even if its own **Max alerts per run** is set higher.

To make sure this rule can generate as many alerts as it's configured in its own **Max alerts per run** setting, increase the `xpack.alerting.rules.run.alerts.max` system setting accordingly.

**NOTE:** Changing `xpack.alerting.rules.run.alerts.max` is not possible in Serverless projects."""
