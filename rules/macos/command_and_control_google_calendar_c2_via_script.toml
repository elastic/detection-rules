Detects a two-stage Google Calendar C2 pattern where a scripting runtime (Node.js, Python, osascript) first 
connects to calendar.app.google to retrieve a hidden C2 address, then initiates a secondary connection to the 
decoded C2 host. This sequence is characteristic of packages using Unicode steganography in Google Calendar 
events to stage dynamic command-and-control endpoints.
