description = """
Detects the execution of a MacOS installer package with an abnormal child process (e.g bash) followed immediately by a network connection via a suspicious process (e.g curl).
Threat actors will build and distribute malicious MacOS installer packages, which have a .pkg extension, many times imitating valid software in order to persuade and infect their victims often using the package files (e.g pre/post install scripts etc.) to download additional tools or malicious software.
If this rule fires it should indicate the installation of a malicious or suspicious package.

    Custom organization-specific macOS packages that use .pkg files to run cURL could trigger this rule. If known
