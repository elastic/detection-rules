### Investigating Persistence via a Hidden Plist Filename

LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons are macOS persistence mechanisms that automatically execute programs at login or system startup. Files with names starting with a dot (.) are hidden from standard directory listings in macOS, making them less visible to users and administrators. Threat actors combine these techniques by creating hidden plist files in LaunchAgent/LaunchDaemon directories to establish stealthy persistence that survives reboots while evading casual inspection. This behavior was notably observed in the CloudMensis macOS spyware campaign.

### Possible investigation steps

- Examine the file.path to identify the full path of the hidden plist file and determine whether it is in a user-specific or system-wide LaunchAgent/LaunchDaemon directory.
- Use plutil or defaults to read the plist contents and identify the executable path, arguments, and execution conditions configured in the ProgramArguments or Program keys.
- Locate the binary or script referenced in the plist file and calculate its hash for threat intelligence lookups.
- Analyze the binary's code signature using codesign -dvvv to determine if it is signed, and by whom.
- Review the process.executable that created the plist file to understand the initial delivery mechanism.
- Check file creation timestamps to determine when the hidden plist was created and correlate with other security events.
- Search for other hidden files in LaunchAgent and LaunchDaemon directories across the system.

### False positive analysis

- Chef configuration management may create hidden plists matching .chef-com* patterns. These are already excluded in the query.
- Some legitimate applications may temporarily create dot-prefixed files during installation. Verify the process that created the file and its signature.
- Backup and synchronization tools occasionally create hidden configuration files. Confirm the tool's legitimacy and expected behavior.
- System processes like sed may create temporary hidden files during in-place editing operations. These are partially excluded in the query.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately unload the hidden LaunchAgent or LaunchDaemon using launchctl unload with the plist path.
- Remove the hidden plist file from the LaunchAgent or LaunchDaemon directory.
- Locate and remove the malicious binary or script referenced in the plist's Program or ProgramArguments keys.
- Search for related hidden files, configuration files, or staging directories that may be part of the same malware deployment.
- Review system logs for evidence of the hidden persistence mechanism executing and what actions it performed.
- Check for data exfiltration or command and control communication if the behavior matches known spyware patterns like CloudMensis.
- Reset credentials that may have been accessed while the persistence mechanism was active.
- Monitor for recreation of hidden plist files in LaunchAgent and LaunchDaemon directories.
