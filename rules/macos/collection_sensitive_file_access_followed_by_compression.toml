### Investigating Sensitive File Access followed by Compression

Data exfiltration is a critical phase of many attack campaigns where threat actors collect and stage sensitive data for transfer out of the environment. On macOS, attackers commonly target high-value files such as SSH keys, AWS credentials, browser cookies, and login keychains. This detection rule identifies a behavioral pattern where a process accesses sensitive files and subsequently creates compressed archives, which is a hallmark of data staging activity prior to exfiltration.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the process.entity_id and process.name fields to identify the application that accessed sensitive files and created the compressed archive.
- Examine the file.path fields in both events to determine which specific sensitive files were accessed and where the archive was created.
- Analyze the process.parent.executable and process.command_line to understand how the process was launched and whether it originated from a suspicious source.
- Check for network connection events from the same process or host shortly after the compression activity, as this may indicate attempted exfiltration.
- Investigate the user.name associated with the activity to determine if the behavior is consistent with their role and normal operations.
- Review the destination path of the compressed file to assess whether it was placed in a location commonly used for staging, such as /Users/Shared or temporary directories.
- Correlate with other security alerts on the same host to identify if this is part of a broader attack chain.

### False positive analysis

- Legitimate backup applications may access sensitive files and create compressed archives as part of scheduled backup operations. Verify the process against known backup tools like Time Machine or third-party backup solutions.
- System administrators performing manual archiving of configuration files or credentials for secure storage may trigger this rule. Confirm with IT operations if such activities were planned.
- Development workflows may involve compressing SSH keys or credentials for transfer between development environments. Review with development teams before escalating.
- Some applications may legitimately compress browser data or credentials during migrations or exports. Verify the application's purpose and user intent.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately isolate the affected macOS system from the network to prevent any pending data exfiltration.
- Identify and quarantine the compressed archive file to prevent it from being transferred or deleted by the attacker.
- Conduct a thorough review of the files that were accessed and compressed to assess the scope of potential data exposure.
- Rotate all credentials that may have been compromised, including SSH keys, AWS access keys, API tokens, and any passwords stored in keychains or browsers.
- Perform a forensic analysis of the system to identify the initial access vector and any persistence mechanisms.
- Review network logs and proxy data to determine if any data was successfully exfiltrated prior to detection.
- Escalate to the incident response team for further investigation if the activity appears to be part of a coordinated attack campaign.
