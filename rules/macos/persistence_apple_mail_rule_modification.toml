### Investigating Suspicious Apple Mail Rule Plist Modification

This detects non-Apple Mail processes creating or modifying the SyncedRules.plist that stores Apple Mail rules, a persistence path because rules can trigger actions on incoming mail. Attackers commonly drop a script to disk, then edit the rules file so a crafted email (often from an attacker-controlled sender or with a specific subject) launches that script when it arrives.

### Possible investigation steps

- Identify the application that modified the plist and validate its legitimacy by checking code signature, bundle path, quarantine/download origin, and recent installation history.  
- Diff the current SyncedRules.plist against a known-good or previous version (including backups/snapshots) to pinpoint what rule entries changed and when.  
- Decode and review the plist contents to find any rule actions that execute scripts/binaries or reference external paths, then record the exact target command/path.  
- Locate and inspect any referenced script or executable (hash, signature, contents, timestamps, and network indicators) and determine whether it is newly created or staged nearby.  
- Correlate the modification time with surrounding system activity (process tree, file writes in user Library paths, network connections, and recent email-related events) to determine whether this is persistence setup versus benign automation.

### False positive analysis

- After a macOS reinstall, user migration, or restore from backup, SyncedRules.plist may be recreated or overwritten by a non-Mail restore/migration process when Mail data is copied back into the user’s MailData directory.  
- User-initiated or administrative automation that standardizes, repairs, or deploys Mail rules can modify SyncedRules.plist via command-line file operations or plist editing outside of Mail.app, especially during initial user provisioning or troubleshooting.

### Response and remediation

- Isolate the affected Mac from the network and temporarily disable Apple Mail rule processing by moving `SyncedRules.plist` out of the MailData directory to prevent any rule-triggered script execution while preserving evidence.  
- Collect and preserve the modified `SyncedRules.plist`, its extended attributes/quarantine flags, and the modifying process binary/app bundle, then decode the plist to identify any rule actions that reference on-disk scripts or executables.  
- Remove malicious persistence by deleting the offending rule entries (or restoring `SyncedRules.plist` from a known-good backup) and deleting/quarantining any referenced scripts/binaries and their launch points if they were dropped on disk.  
- Hunt for and eradicate the originator by reviewing recently installed or unsigned apps and user-level agents/daemons that wrote into `~/Library/Mail/**/MailData/`, and reimage the endpoint if additional persistence or tampering is found.  
- Recover by re-enabling Mail with a clean ruleset, forcing credential/session resets for affected mail accounts, and monitoring for recurrence of `SyncedRules.plist` changes or rule-triggered execution when new mail arrives.  
- Escalate to incident response immediately if the plist contains rules invoking `sh`, `osascript`, `python`, or a non-Apple executable path, if the modifying process is unsigned/untrusted, or if the referenced script shows network beacons or data access behavior.
