### Investigating Suspicious Curl from macOS Application

Trojanized macOS applications often use curl to download second-stage payloads from attacker-controlled infrastructure. By leveraging curl instead of direct downloads, these malicious applications can bypass Gatekeeper quarantine checks and evade built-in macOS security mechanisms. This detection rule identifies when applications from the /Applications directory spawn curl to connect to raw IP addresses, which is highly indicative of malicious payload retrieval activity.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the process.Ext.effective_parent.executable field to identify which application spawned the curl process and assess whether this application is expected to make network downloads.
- Examine the process.args fields to extract the destination IP address and URL path being accessed, and research these indicators in threat intelligence databases.
- Analyze the process.parent.command_line to understand the full context of how curl was invoked, including any output file paths that may indicate where payloads were written.
- Check the code signature of the parent application using the process.code_signature fields to determine if it is validly signed and if the signature matches known good versions.
- Investigate the origin of the suspicious application by reviewing installation logs, download history, and any recent DMG or PKG files that may have delivered the trojanized application.
- Search for any files created on disk around the time of the curl execution to identify downloaded payloads that may have been staged for execution.
- Correlate with other events on the same host to identify if the downloaded payload was subsequently executed.

### False positive analysis

- Some legitimate applications may use curl for software updates or telemetry data collection. Verify the destination IP against the application vendor's known infrastructure.
- Development tools and IDEs may download dependencies or packages via curl during normal operations. Review the context and confirm with development teams.
- Homebrew and package managers may spawn curl from application contexts during installations. Verify if package management activities were expected.
- Add verified legitimate applications to the exclusion list in the query after confirming their behavior is expected.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately quarantine the suspicious application by moving it to a secure location and removing it from /Applications to prevent further execution.
- Block the destination IP address at the network perimeter and on endpoint firewalls to prevent additional downloads.
- Search the file system for any payloads that may have been downloaded and quarantine them for analysis.
- Conduct a full malware scan on the affected system to identify any persistence mechanisms or additional malware components.
- Report the trojanized application to Apple Security and relevant threat intelligence sharing platforms.
- Review other systems in the environment for the same trojanized application to determine the scope of potential compromise.
- Investigate the delivery mechanism to understand how the trojanized application was installed and prevent future infections.
