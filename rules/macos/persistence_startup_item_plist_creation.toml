### Investigating Suspicious StartupItem Plist Creation

StartupItems are a deprecated macOS persistence mechanism that predates LaunchDaemons and was phased out after OS X Mavericks. Despite deprecation, the StartupItem infrastructure still functions on modern macOS versions for backward compatibility. Because legitimate software no longer uses StartupItems, the creation of a StartupParameters.plist file in /Library/StartupItems/ or /System/Library/StartupItems/ is highly anomalous and strongly indicates malicious activity seeking persistence through an overlooked mechanism.

### Possible investigation steps

- Examine the file.path to identify the specific StartupItem directory and verify that it was newly created versus modified.
- Review the StartupParameters.plist contents using plutil to identify the Description, Provides, OrderPreference, and other configuration values.
- Locate the StartupItem script in the same directory (typically named after the item) and analyze its contents for malicious commands.
- Check the process.executable that created the StartupItem to understand the initial delivery mechanism.
- Review file creation timestamps to correlate the StartupItem creation with other suspicious activity on the system.
- Search for additional files or binaries that may have been deployed alongside the StartupItem.
- Check for corresponding entries in /etc/rc files that may interact with the StartupItem.

### False positive analysis

- Very old legacy applications may use StartupItems for backward compatibility. Verify the software's legitimacy and whether it is still supported.
- Some enterprise or industrial software may not have been updated to use modern persistence mechanisms. Confirm with IT operations if legacy software is expected.
- Apple's shove process is already excluded in the query as it may interact with StartupItem directories during system maintenance.

### Response and remediation

- Remove the entire StartupItem directory containing the malicious StartupParameters.plist and associated scripts.
- Verify that the StartupItem was not successfully executed by checking system logs for execution evidence.
- Reboot the system to confirm the StartupItem has been fully removed and no longer executes.
- Investigate the initial access vector that allowed creation of the StartupItem.
- Search for other deprecated persistence mechanisms on the system that may indicate comprehensive malware deployment.
- Review other systems in the environment for similar StartupItem creations.
- Monitor the /Library/StartupItems/ directory for future unauthorized file creation.
- Consider implementing file integrity monitoring on persistence directories to detect future modifications.
