### Investigating Suspicious Curl to Google App Script Endpoint

This rule detects curl requests to Google Apps Script endpoints, which can be abused as a simple C2 channel. Threat actors use these legitimate Google services to host malicious scripts that evade network filtering.

### Possible investigation steps

- Identify the process and user making the Google Apps Script request.
- Review the specific Apps Script URL being accessed.
- Check if the Apps Script deployment is associated with your organization.
- Analyze any response data for C2 commands or payloads.

### False positive analysis

- Legitimate automation may use Google Apps Script for workflows.
- Business applications may integrate with Google services.

### Response and remediation

- Block access to unauthorized Google Apps Script deployments.
- Investigate the script to understand the malicious functionality.
- Report the malicious Apps Script to Google for takedown.
- Search for similar activity across other endpoints.
