Identifies when a screensaver plist file is modified by an unexpected process. An adversary can maintain persistence on

- Analyze the plist file modification event to identify whether the change was expected or not

## Setup

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.
