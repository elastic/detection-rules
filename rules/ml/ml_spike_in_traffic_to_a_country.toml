A machine learning job detected an unusually large spike in network activity to one 
destination country in the network logs. This could be due to unusually large amounts 
of reconnaissance or enumeration traffic. Data exfiltration activity may also produce 
such a surge in traffic to a destination country which does not normally appear in network 
traffic or business work-flows. Malware instances and persistence mechanisms may communicate 
with command-and-control (C2) infrastructure in their country of origin, which may be an 
unusual destination country for the source network.

    countries for brief periods may trigger this alert if they engage in volumetric network activity.
