A machine learning job detected unusually large numbers of DNS queries for a single top-level DNS domain, which is often
used for DNS tunneling. DNS tunneling can be used for command-and-control, persistence, or data exfiltration activity.
For example, dnscat tends to generate many DNS questions for a top-level domain as it uses the DNS protocol to tunnel
data.
