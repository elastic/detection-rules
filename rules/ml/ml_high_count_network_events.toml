This rule requires the installation of associated Machine Learning jobs, as well as data coming in from one of the following integrations:
- Elastic Defend
- Network Packet Capture

### Anomaly Detection Setup

Once the rule is enabled, the associated Machine Learning job will start automatically. You can view the Machine Learning job linked under the "Definition" panel of the detection rule. If the job does not start due to an error, the issue must be resolved for the job to commence successfully. For more details on setting up anomaly detection jobs, refer to the [helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/xpack-ml-anomalies.html).

### Elastic Defend Integration Setup
Elastic Defend is integrated into the Elastic Agent using Fleet. Upon configuration, the integration allows the Elastic Agent to monitor events on your host and send data to the Elastic Security app.

#### Prerequisite Requirements:
- Fleet is required for Elastic Defend.
- To configure Fleet Server refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-server.html).

#### The following steps should be executed in order to add the Elastic Defend integration to your system:
- Go to the Kibana home page and click "Add integrations".
- In the query bar, search for "Elastic Defend" and select the integration to see more details about it.
- Click "Add Elastic Defend".
- Configure the integration name and optionally add a description.
- Select the type of environment you want to protect, either "Traditional Endpoints" or "Cloud Workloads".
- Select a configuration preset. Each preset comes with different default settings for Elastic Agent, you can further customize these later by configuring the Elastic Defend integration policy. [Helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/configure-endpoint-integration-policy.html).
- We suggest selecting "Complete EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)" as a configuration setting, that provides "All events; all preventions"
- Enter a name for the agent policy in "New agent policy name". If other agent policies already exist, you can click the "Existing hosts" tab and select an existing policy instead.
For more details on Elastic Agent configuration settings, refer to the [helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/agent-policy.html).
- Click "Save and Continue".
- To complete the integration, select "Add Elastic Agent to your hosts" and continue to the next section to install the Elastic Agent on your hosts.
For more details on Elastic Defend refer to the [helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/install-endpoint.html).

### Network Packet Capture Integration Setup
The Network Packet Capture integration sniffs network packets on a host and dissects known protocols. Monitoring the network traffic is critical to gaining observability and securing your environment — ensuring high levels of performance and security. The Network Packet Capture integration captures the network traffic between your application servers, decodes common application layer protocols and records the interesting fields for each transaction.

#### The following steps should be executed in order to add the Elastic Agent System integration "network_traffic" to your system:
- Go to the Kibana home page and click “Add integrations”.
- In the query bar, search for “Network Packet Capture” and select the integration to see more details about it.
- Click “Add Network Packet Capture”.
- Configure the integration name and optionally add a description.
- Review optional and advanced settings accordingly.
- Add the newly installed “network_traffic” to an existing or a new agent policy, and deploy the agent on your system from which network log files are desirable.
- Click “Save and Continue”.
- For more details on the integration refer to the [helper guide](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/network_traffic).

### Investigating Spike in Network Traffic

Machine learning models monitor network traffic patterns to identify anomalies, such as unexpected spikes. These spikes may indicate malicious activities like data exfiltration, reconnaissance, or denial-of-service attacks. Adversaries exploit network vulnerabilities to flood traffic or extract data. The detection rule leverages these models to flag unusual traffic surges, prompting further investigation into potential threats.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the timestamp of the spike to correlate with any scheduled business activities or known events that could justify the increase in traffic.
- Analyze the source and destination IP addresses involved in the spike to identify any known malicious actors or unusual patterns.
- Examine the network protocols and ports used during the spike to determine if they align with typical business operations or if they suggest suspicious activity.
- Check for any recent changes in network configurations or firewall rules that could have inadvertently caused the spike.
- Utilize Osquery to gather additional context on the systems involved. For example, run the following query to list active network connections: `SELECT * FROM process_open_sockets WHERE remote_address IS NOT NULL;`
- Investigate the volume and type of data being transferred during the spike to assess if it aligns with potential data exfiltration activities.
- Cross-reference the spike with any other security alerts or logs from intrusion detection systems to identify potential correlations.
- Review user activity logs to determine if any unauthorized access or unusual user behavior coincides with the spike.
- Check for any recent vulnerabilities or exploits that could have been leveraged to cause the spike in traffic.
- Consult threat intelligence sources to see if there are any reports of similar traffic patterns or attacks targeting your industry or organization.

### False positive analysis

- Legitimate business activities such as scheduled data backups or software updates can cause spikes in network traffic, which may be mistakenly flagged as suspicious. 
- High-volume data transfers during peak business hours or due to seasonal business demands can also trigger false positives.
- Network performance testing or stress testing activities might generate traffic patterns similar to those of a denial-of-service attack.
- Users can manage these false positives by creating exceptions for known, recurring activities that are verified as non-threatening.
- Implementing a whitelist for IP addresses or domains associated with trusted business operations can help reduce false alerts.
- Regularly updating the machine learning model with feedback on false positives can improve its accuracy over time.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or damage.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the source and nature of the traffic spike, using network logs and monitoring tools.
- Analyze the traffic patterns to determine if the spike correlates with known malicious activities, referencing MITRE ATT&CK for potential tactics and techniques.
- If malicious activity is confirmed, remove any identified malware or unauthorized access points from the affected systems.
- Escalate the incident to the appropriate internal teams and, if necessary, external cybersecurity experts for further analysis and response.
- Implement enhanced logging policies to capture detailed network traffic data for future analysis and early detection of anomalies.
- Integrate additional security tools, such as intrusion detection systems (IDS) or endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, to improve monitoring capabilities.
- Restore affected systems to their operational state by applying necessary patches, updates, and configurations to close any exploited vulnerabilities.
- Conduct a post-incident review to identify gaps in the current security posture and update incident response plans accordingly.
- Implement network hardening measures, such as segmenting the network, applying strict access controls, and regularly updating firewall rules, to prevent future incidents."""
