The rule requires the Lateral Movement Detection integration assets to be installed, as well as file and Windows RDP process events collected by the Elastic Defend integration.

### Lateral Movement Detection Setup
The Lateral Movement Detection integration detects lateral movement activity by identifying abnormalities in file and Windows RDP events. Anomalies are detected using Elastic's Anomaly Detection feature.

#### Prerequisite Requirements:
- Fleet is required for Lateral Movement Detection.
- To configure Fleet Server refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-server.html).
- Windows RDP process events collected by the [Elastic Defend](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/endpoint) integration.
- To install Elastic Defend, refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/install-endpoint.html).

#### The following steps should be executed to install assets associated with the Lateral Movement Detection integration:
- Go to the Kibana homepage. Under Management, click Integrations.
- In the query bar, search for Lateral Movement Detection and select the integration to see more details about it.
- Follow the instructions under the **Installation** section.
- For this rule to work, complete the instructions through **Add preconfigured anomaly detection jobs**.

### Investigating Spike in Number of Connections Made to a Destination IP

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is crucial for remote management and troubleshooting in IT environments. However, adversaries exploit RDP by using multiple compromised IPs to overwhelm a target, ensuring persistence even if some IPs are blocked. The detection rule leverages machine learning to identify unusual spikes in RDP connections to a single IP, signaling potential lateral movement attempts by attackers.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the list of source IPs that have established RDP connections to the destination IP to identify any known malicious or suspicious IP addresses.
- Check historical data for the destination IP to determine if it has been targeted in previous attacks or if it is a high-value asset within the network.
- Analyze the timing and frequency of the RDP connections to identify any unusual patterns or spikes that could indicate coordinated activity.
- Investigate the user accounts associated with the RDP connections to ensure they are legitimate and have not been compromised.
- Correlate the detected activity with any other security alerts or logs to identify potential lateral movement or further exploitation attempts within the network.

### False positive analysis

- Routine administrative tasks may trigger false positives if multiple IT staff connect to a server for maintenance. Consider creating exceptions for known administrative IPs.
- Automated scripts or monitoring tools that frequently connect to servers for health checks can cause spikes. Identify and exclude these IPs from the rule.
- Load balancers or proxy servers that aggregate connections from multiple clients might appear as a spike. Exclude these devices from the detection rule.
- Scheduled software updates or deployments that require multiple connections to a server can be mistaken for an attack. Whitelist the IPs involved in these processes.
- Internal network scans or vulnerability assessments conducted by security teams can generate high connection counts. Ensure these activities are recognized and excluded.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately isolate the affected destination IP from the network to prevent further unauthorized RDP connections and potential lateral movement.
- Conduct a thorough review of the logs and network traffic associated with the destination IP to identify all source IPs involved in the spike and assess the scope of the compromise.
- Block all identified malicious source IPs at the firewall or network perimeter to prevent further connections to the destination IP.
- Reset credentials and enforce multi-factor authentication for accounts that were accessed via RDP to mitigate unauthorized access.
- Perform a security assessment of the affected systems to identify any signs of compromise or unauthorized changes, and restore systems from clean backups if necessary.
- Escalate the incident to the security operations center (SOC) or incident response team for further investigation and to determine if additional systems or networks are affected.
- Update and enhance monitoring rules to detect similar patterns of unusual RDP connection spikes in the future, ensuring quick identification and response to potential threats."""
