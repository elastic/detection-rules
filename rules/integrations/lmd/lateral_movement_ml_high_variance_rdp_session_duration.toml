The rule requires the Lateral Movement Detection integration assets to be installed, as well as file and Windows RDP process events collected by the Elastic Defend integration.  

### Lateral Movement Detection Setup
The Lateral Movement Detection integration detects lateral movement activity by identifying abnormalities in file and Windows RDP events. Anomalies are detected using Elastic's Anomaly Detection feature.

#### Prerequisite Requirements:
- Fleet is required for Lateral Movement Detection.
- To configure Fleet Server refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-server.html).
- Windows RDP process events collected by the [Elastic Defend](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/endpoint) integration.
- To install Elastic Defend, refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/install-endpoint.html).

#### The following steps should be executed to install assets associated with the Lateral Movement Detection integration:
- Go to the Kibana homepage. Under Management, click Integrations.
- In the query bar, search for Lateral Movement Detection and select the integration to see more details about it.
- Follow the instructions under the **Installation** section.
- For this rule to work, complete the instructions through **Add preconfigured anomaly detection jobs**.
