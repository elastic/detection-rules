A machine learning job has detected an unusually high file size shared by a remote host indicating potential lateral
movement activity. One of the primary goals of attackers after gaining access to a network is to locate and exfiltrate
valuable information. Instead of multiple small transfers that can raise alarms, attackers might choose to bundle data
into a single large file transfer.
