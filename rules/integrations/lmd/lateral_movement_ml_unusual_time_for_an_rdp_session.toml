The rule requires the Lateral Movement Detection integration assets to be installed, as well as file and Windows RDP process events collected by the Elastic Defend integration.  

### Lateral Movement Detection Setup
The Lateral Movement Detection integration detects lateral movement activity by identifying abnormalities in file and Windows RDP events. Anomalies are detected using Elastic's Anomaly Detection feature.

#### Prerequisite Requirements:
- Fleet is required for Lateral Movement Detection.
- To configure Fleet Server refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-server.html).
- Windows RDP process events collected by the [Elastic Defend](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/endpoint) integration.
- To install Elastic Defend, refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/install-endpoint.html).

#### The following steps should be executed to install assets associated with the Lateral Movement Detection integration:
- Go to the Kibana homepage. Under Management, click Integrations.
- In the query bar, search for Lateral Movement Detection and select the integration to see more details about it.
- Under Settings, click Install Lateral Movement Detection assets and follow the prompts to install the assets.

#### Anomaly Detection Setup
Before you can enable rules for Lateral Movement Detection, you'll need to enable the corresponding Anomaly Detection jobs.
- Before enabling the Anomaly Detection jobs, confirm that the Pivot Transform asset is installed and actively gathering data in the destination index `ml-rdp-lmd`.
- Go to the Kibana homepage. Under Analytics, click Machine Learning.
- Under Anomaly Detection, click Jobs, and then click "Create job". Select the Data View containing your transformed RDP process data i.e.`ml-rdp-lmd`.
- If the selected Data View contains events that match the query in [this](https://github.com/elastic/integrations/blob/main/packages/lmd/kibana/ml_module/lmd-ml.json) configuration file, you will see a card for Lateral Movement Detection under "Use preconfigured jobs".
- Keep the default settings and click "Create jobs" to start the anomaly detection jobs and datafeeds.
