The rule requires the Privileged Access Detection integration assets to be installed, as well as Windows logs collected by integrations such as Elastic Defend and Windows.

### Privileged Access Detection Setup
The Privileged Access Detection integration detects privileged access activity by identifying abnormalities in Windows, Linux and Okta events. Anomalies are detected using Elastic's Anomaly Detection feature.

#### Prerequisite Requirements:
- Fleet is required for Privileged Access Detection.
- To configure Fleet Server refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-server.html).
- Windows events collected by the [Elastic Defend](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/endpoint) and [Windows](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/windows) integration.
- To install Elastic Defend, refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/install-endpoint.html).
- To add the Windows integration to an Elastic Agent policy, refer to [this](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/add-integration-to-policy.html) guide.

#### The following steps should be executed to install assets associated with the Privileged Access Detection integration:
- Go to the Kibana homepage. Under Management, click Integrations.
- In the query bar, search for Privileged Access Detection and select the integration to see more details about it.
- Follow the instructions under the **Installation** section.
- For this rule to work, complete the instructions through **Add preconfigured anomaly detection jobs**.
