This rule detects the access of the Kubelet certificate file inside a container. The Kubelet certificate file is
used to authenticate the container to the Kubernetes API server, and may be used by an adversary to gain access
to the Kubernetes API server or other resources within the cluster. These files are a common target for adversaries
to gain access to the cluster. There is a current limitation in the defend for containers file sensor that prevents
file open events from being logged for file open events without write intent.
