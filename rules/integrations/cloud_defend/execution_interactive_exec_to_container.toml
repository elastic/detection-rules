description = """
This rule detects interactive 'exec' events launched against a container using the 'exec' command. Using the 'exec'
command in a pod allows a user to establish a temporary shell session and execute any process/command inside the
container. This rule specifically targets higher-risk interactive commands that allow real-time interaction with a
container's shell. A malicious actor could use this level of access to further compromise the container environment or
attempt a container breakout.

    An administrator may need to exec into a pod for a legitimate reason like debugging purposes. Containers built from
    Linux and Windows OS images, tend to include debugging utilities. In this case, an admin may choose to run commands
    inside a specific container with kubectl exec ${POD_NAME} -c ${CONTAINER_NAME} -- ${CMD} ${ARG1} ${ARG2} ...
    ${ARGN}. For example, the following command can be used to look at logs from a running Cassandra pod: kubectl exec
    cassandra --cat /var/log/cassandra/system.log . Additionally, the -i and -t arguments might be used to run a shell
    connected to the terminal: kubectl exec -i -t cassandra -- sh
