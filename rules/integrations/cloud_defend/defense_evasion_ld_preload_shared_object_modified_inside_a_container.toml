description = """
This rule detects the creation or modification of the dynamic linker preload shared object (ld.so.preload) inside a
container. The Linux dynamic linker is used to load libraries needed by a program at runtime. Adversaries may hijack the
dynamic linker by modifying the /etc/ld.so.preload file to point to malicious libraries. This behavior can be used to
grant unauthorized access to system resources and has been used to evade detection of malicious processes in container
environments.
