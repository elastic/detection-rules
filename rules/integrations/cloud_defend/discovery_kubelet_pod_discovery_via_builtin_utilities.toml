### Investigating Kubelet Pod Discovery via Built-In Utilities Detected via Defend for Containers

This rule detects interactive use of common Linux utilities (ls, find, du, locate, nice) repeatedly targeting the Kubelet pods directory, including direct access to `/var/lib/kubelet/pods/*`. This matters because enumerating that path reveals pod IDs, volumes, and runtime artifacts that can accelerate container and cluster discovery. A typical pattern is an attacker in a compromised container running `ls /var/lib/kubelet/pods/` followed by `find /var/lib/kubelet/pods -maxdepth 2` to map workloads and hunt for mounted secrets.

### Possible investigation steps

- Identify the originating workload (pod/namespace/node) and how the interactive session was obtained (e.g., kubectl exec, SSH to node, or container runtime attach) to determine whether access was expected.  
- Review the container’s security context and mounts to confirm whether `/var/lib/kubelet` was exposed via hostPath/privileged settings and assess whether this indicates a node breakout risk.  
- Correlate the discovery activity with nearby events for follow-on actions such as reading service account tokens, kubeconfig files, or secrets/volumes under pod directories that would indicate credential harvesting.  
- Validate the actor by mapping the involved user/service account to recent Kubernetes API audit activity and RBAC permissions to determine whether the behavior aligns with normal administration.  
- Check for persistence or lateral movement attempts from the same container or node (new processes, outbound connections, package/tool downloads, or cron/systemd changes) to scope impact beyond discovery.

### False positive analysis

- An interactive troubleshooting session by a cluster administrator inside a privileged/host-mounted container uses `ls`, `find`, or `du` against `/var/lib/kubelet/pods/*` multiple times to confirm pod volume mounts, disk usage, or pod UID-to-workload mapping during an incident or maintenance window.  
- An engineer running an interactive shell on the node or in a hostPID/hostPath-enabled container repeatedly inspects `/var/lib/kubelet/pods/*` with built-in utilities to validate kubelet behavior (e.g., orphaned pod directories, cleanup after pod churn, or verifying that expected pods are present) as part of routine operational checks.

### Response and remediation

- Contain by terminating the interactive session and isolating the originating pod (scale to zero or delete) and, if the container had hostPath access to `/var/lib/kubelet` or was privileged/hostPID, cordon and drain the node to stop further inspection of `/var/lib/kubelet/pods/*`.  
- Scope and eradicate by reviewing recent commands and file reads under `/var/lib/kubelet/pods/` for access to mounted secrets, service account tokens, kubeconfig files, or pod volume contents, and remove any dropped tools/scripts or unauthorized cron/systemd changes on the affected node.  
- Recover by rotating potentially exposed Kubernetes credentials (service account tokens, kubeconfigs, cloud/IAM keys) used by the affected workload and redeploying the application from a known-good image after validating no unexpected containers, DaemonSets, or mounts remain.  
- Escalate to incident response immediately if you confirm reads of token/secret material within pod directories, discovery occurs from a privileged or host-mounted container, or you observe follow-on actions such as outbound connections, new binaries, or attempts to exec into additional pods/namespaces.  
- Harden by eliminating unnecessary hostPath mounts to `/var/lib/kubelet` (and other node paths), enforcing non-root and read-only root filesystems, disabling interactive shells in production where feasible, and applying admission controls to block privileged/hostPID containers and restrict debug tooling to approved break-glass workflows."""
