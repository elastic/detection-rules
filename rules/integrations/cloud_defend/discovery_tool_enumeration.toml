### Investigating Tool Enumeration Detected via Defend for Containers

Detects interactive use of which inside a Linux container to list installed networking, container-control, compiler, and scanning utilities. Adversaries do this to quickly assess built-in tools for living-off-the-land actions like payload download, cluster manipulation, or reconnaissance without dropping new binaries. Example: after compromising a Kubernetes pod, an operator runs which curl wget kubectl nmap python to decide how to transfer data, interact with the API, or probe the network.

### Possible investigation steps

- Correlate Kubernetes audit logs to determine whether the pod was accessed via kubectl exec, attach, or an ephemeral container and to identify the requesting user, source IP, and user agent.
- Review the container’s process tree and TTY session around the alert time to see if the same session subsequently executed the enumerated utilities or performed network reconnaissance or data transfer.
- Analyze outbound network connections and DNS queries from the pod around the event to unfamiliar destinations or cluster control-plane endpoints and compare them against expected egress policy.
- Inspect pod and container metadata (namespace, service account, image, node) and evaluate RBAC bindings and mounted secrets to gauge potential impact and access scope.
- Confirm with the service owner whether this interactive container access aligns with an approved maintenance or debugging task and gather the corresponding change ticket or runbook reference.

### False positive analysis

- An engineer opens an interactive shell in a container for approved troubleshooting and runs which on utilities like curl, wget, kubectl, and python to confirm tool availability before debugging.
- During routine post-deployment checks, an operator follows a runbook that uses which to verify paths for expected binaries such as openssl and gcc inside the container, resulting in a benign alert.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately terminate any active TTY/shell in the affected pod (namespace/name) and isolate it by applying a temporary deny-all NetworkPolicy and removing exec/attach permissions from its service account.
- Delete the pod and any attached ephemeral debug container, redeploy from a known-good image, and rotate mounted secrets, cloud credentials, and the service account token present in the container.
- Restore service from clean deployments and verify the workload behaves as expected by running smoke tests and confirming the pod’s outbound connections are limited to approved destinations and ports.
- Escalate to the incident response team if the same session executed kubectl or docker, ran scanning tools such as nmap/masscan, accessed /var/run/secrets or changed RBAC, or connected to unfamiliar external IPs or the Kubernetes API server, and preserve evidence (container filesystem snapshot, shell history, Kubernetes audit logs, and node syslogs).
- Harden by enforcing admission controls to block interactive kubectl exec/attach to production pods and requiring runAsNonRoot, a read-only root filesystem, and dropped Linux capabilities on this workload.
- Reduce living-off-the-land options by rebuilding images to distroless/minimal and omitting utilities enumerated by which (curl, wget, nc, python, kubectl), and restrict egress with NetworkPolicies and service account RBAC to prevent cluster manipulation from inside containers.
