  There is a potential for false positives if the container is used for legitimate administrative tasks that require the use of container management utilities, such as deploying, scaling, or updating containerized applications. It is important to investigate any alerts generated by this rule to determine if they are indicative of malicious activity or part of legitimate container activity.
