description = """
This rule detects modification of the cgroup notify_on_release file from inside a container. When the notify_on_release
flag is enabled (1) in a cgroup, then whenever the last task in the cgroup exits or attaches to another cgroup, the
command specified in the release_agent file is run and invoked from the host. A privileged container with SYS_ADMIN
capabilities, enables a threat actor to mount a cgroup directory and modify the notify_on_release flag in order to take
advantage of this feature, which could be used for further privilege escalation and container escapes to the host
machine.
