### Investigating Tool Installation Detected via Defend for Containers

This rule flags interactive package installs inside Linux containers for network utilities or interpreters, a strong signal of hands-on activity to enumerate, fetch payloads, and pivot. Example attacker pattern: after gaining a shell in a pod, they run apt/apk/pacman to add curl, netcat, or socat, pull a second stage from an external host, and open a reverse shell to move from the container into adjacent services.

### Possible investigation steps

- Attribute the interactive install by correlating Kubernetes audit events (exec/attach) and runtime logs to the pod/namespace, a specific user or service account, source IP, and client, and verify alignment with approved break-glass procedures.
- Diff the running container filesystem against the image baseline or SBOM to enumerate newly added binaries and libraries, review package manager logs/cache, and capture hashes and paths for forensics.
- Examine pod-level network telemetry and DNS logs around the event for outbound connections, downloads, or reverse shell patterns, and isolate the workload if beaconing or exfiltration is observed.
- Verify the pod’s security context and mounts for privilege escalation vectors (privileged, hostPID/IPC, hostPaths, docker.sock) and inventory exposed credentials (service account tokens, cloud metadata, env vars, ~/.ssh, .aws), rotating any secrets at risk.
- Hunt across the cluster for similar interactive installs or exec sessions using audit and Defend for Containers telemetry, and review recent image builds and deployments to detect in-cluster modifications before quarantining or restarting affected workloads.

### False positive analysis

- A developer attaches an interactive shell to a running container to debug connectivity, using apt or apk to install curl or netcat for quick tests, which matches the rule’s interactive install of network utilities.
- During an approved break-glass fix, an operator interactively installs python or openssl with yum or dnf in a minimal container to run a temporary diagnostic script, triggering the same package-install signature.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately isolate the pod/container that performed interactive installs (e.g., apt-get install curl, apk add netcat) by applying a deny-all NetworkPolicy, terminating active kubectl exec/attach sessions, and cordoning the node if the pod is privileged or has hostPath/docker.sock mounts.
- Stop and delete the compromised workload, snapshot the container filesystem, then redeploy the deployment/statefulset from a trusted image and purge added tools by removing packages and caches (/var/lib/apt, /var/cache/apk, /var/cache/yum) from any retained volumes.
- Rotate the pod’s service account token and any exposed credentials found in env vars, ~/.ssh, or cloud provider metadata, and invalidate outbound connections established by newly installed binaries like curl, wget, socat, or netcat via egress firewall rules.
- Restore normal connectivity only after confirming no unauthorized binaries remain by diffing against the image SBOM and checking package history files like /var/log/dpkg.log, /var/log/yum.log, or /etc/apk/world, then validating app readiness/liveness probes.
- Escalate to incident response if the install included tor/torsocks, openssl used to generate new keys, reverse-shell behavior (e.g., netcat -e or socat TCP:external_ip), or if activity occurred in production without a change request.
- Enforce immutability and least privilege by rebuilding images without package managers or shells (distroless), enabling read-only root filesystems, disallowing kubectl exec via RBAC, using admission controls to block privileged pods and hostPath/docker.sock mounts, and tightening egress to only approved destinations.
