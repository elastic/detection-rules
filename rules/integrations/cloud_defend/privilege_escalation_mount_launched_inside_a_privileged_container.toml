description = """
This rule detects the use of the mount utility from inside a privileged container. The mount command is used to make a
device or file system accessible to the system, and then to connect its root directory to a specified mount point on the
local file system. When launched inside a privileged container--a container deployed with all the capabilities of the
host machine-- an attacker can access sensitive host level files which could be used for further privilege escalation
and container escapes to the host machine. Any usage of mount inside a running privileged container should be further
investigated.
