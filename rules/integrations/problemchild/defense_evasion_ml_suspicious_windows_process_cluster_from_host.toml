description = """
A machine learning job combination has detected a set of one or more suspicious Windows processes with unusually high
scores for malicious probability. These process(es) have been classified as malicious in several ways. The process(es)
were predicted to be malicious by the ProblemChild supervised ML model. If the anomaly contains a cluster of suspicious
processes, each process has the same host name, and the aggregate score of the event cluster was calculated to be
unusually high by an unsupervised ML model. Such a cluster often contains suspicious or malicious activity, possibly
involving LOLbins, that may be resistant to detection using conventional search rules.
