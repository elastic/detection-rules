A machine learning job has detected a suspicious Windows process. This process has been classified as suspicious in two
ways. It was predicted to be suspicious by the ProblemChild supervised ML model, and it was found to be an unusual
process, on a host that does not commonly manifest malicious activity. Such a process may be an instance of suspicious
or malicious activity, possibly involving LOLbins, that may be resistant to detection using conventional search rules.
