### Investigating Microsoft 365 Exchange Anti-Phish Policy Deletion

Microsoft 365's anti-phishing policies enhance security by fine-tuning detection settings to thwart phishing attacks. Adversaries may delete these policies to weaken defenses, facilitating unauthorized access. The detection rule monitors audit logs for successful deletions of anti-phishing policies, signaling potential malicious activity by identifying specific actions and outcomes associated with policy removal.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the audit logs for the specific event.action "Remove-AntiPhishPolicy" to identify the user account responsible for the deletion.
- Check the event.outcome field to confirm the success of the policy deletion and gather additional context from related logs around the same timestamp.
- Investigate the user account's recent activities in Microsoft 365 to identify any other suspicious actions or anomalies, such as unusual login locations or times.
- Assess whether the user account has been compromised by checking for any unauthorized access attempts or changes in account settings.
- Evaluate the impact of the deleted anti-phishing policy by reviewing the organization's current phishing protection measures and any recent phishing incidents.
- Coordinate with the IT security team to determine if the policy deletion was authorized or part of a legitimate change management process.

### False positive analysis

- Routine administrative actions may trigger the rule if IT staff regularly update or remove outdated anti-phishing policies. To manage this, create exceptions for known administrative accounts performing these actions.
- Scheduled policy reviews might involve the removal of policies as part of a legitimate update process. Document these schedules and exclude them from triggering alerts by setting time-based exceptions.
- Automated scripts used for policy management can inadvertently cause false positives. Identify and whitelist these scripts to prevent unnecessary alerts.
- Changes in organizational policy that require the removal of certain anti-phishing policies can be mistaken for malicious activity. Ensure that such changes are communicated and logged, and adjust the rule to recognize these legitimate actions.
- Test environments where policies are frequently added and removed for validation purposes can generate false positives. Exclude these environments from the rule to avoid confusion.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately isolate the affected user accounts and systems to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- Recreate the deleted anti-phishing policy using the latest security guidelines and ensure it is applied across all relevant user groups.
- Conduct a thorough review of recent email activity and logs for the affected accounts to identify any phishing emails that may have bypassed security measures.
- Reset passwords for affected accounts and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance account security.
- Notify the security team and relevant stakeholders about the incident for awareness and further investigation.
- Escalate the incident to the incident response team if there is evidence of broader compromise or if sensitive data has been accessed.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for similar actions in the future to quickly detect and respond to any further attempts to delete security policies.
