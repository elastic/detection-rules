### Investigating Attempts to Brute Force a Microsoft 365 User Account

Microsoft 365 is a cloud-based service that provides productivity tools and services. Adversaries may attempt to gain unauthorized access by brute-forcing user accounts, exploiting weak passwords. The detection rule identifies such attempts by analyzing audit logs for numerous failed logins or diverse login sources within a short timeframe, indicating potential brute-force activity.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the audit logs for the specific user identified by o365.audit.UserId to gather additional context on the failed login attempts, including timestamps and source IP addresses.
- Analyze the source.ip field to identify any unusual or suspicious IP addresses, such as those originating from unexpected geographic locations or known malicious sources.
- Check the o365.audit.LogonError field for any patterns or specific errors that might provide insight into the nature of the failed login attempts.
- Investigate the o365.audit.ExtendedProperties.RequestType to determine if the login attempts were consistent with typical user behavior or if they suggest automated or scripted activity.
- Correlate the findings with other security events or alerts in the environment to assess if the brute-force attempts are part of a larger attack campaign or isolated incidents.
- Contact the affected user to verify if they experienced any issues accessing their account and to ensure they are aware of the potential security threat.

### False positive analysis

- High volume of legitimate login attempts from a single user can trigger false positives, especially during password resets or account recovery. To mitigate, consider excluding specific users or IP ranges known for such activities.
- Automated scripts or applications performing frequent logins for legitimate purposes may be misidentified as brute-force attempts. Identify and whitelist these scripts or applications by their user IDs or IP addresses.
- Users traveling or using VPNs may log in from multiple locations in a short period, leading to false positives. Implement geolocation-based exceptions for known travel patterns or VPN IP addresses.
- Shared accounts accessed by multiple users from different locations can appear as multiple login sources. Limit monitoring on shared accounts or establish a baseline of expected behavior to differentiate between normal and suspicious activity.
- Temporary spikes in login attempts due to system maintenance or updates can be mistaken for brute-force attacks. Schedule monitoring exclusions during planned maintenance windows to avoid false alerts.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately isolate the affected user account by disabling it to prevent further unauthorized access attempts.
- Notify the user and relevant IT security personnel about the potential compromise and provide guidance on secure password creation.
- Conduct a password reset for the affected user account, ensuring the new password adheres to strong password policies.
- Review and analyze the source IP addresses involved in the failed login attempts to identify any patterns or known malicious sources.
- Implement conditional access policies to restrict login attempts from suspicious or untrusted locations and devices.
- Monitor the affected account and related accounts for any unusual activity or further unauthorized access attempts.
- Escalate the incident to the security operations center (SOC) or incident response team for further investigation and to determine if additional accounts or systems are affected."""
