### Investigating Multiple Microsoft 365 User Account Lockouts in Short Time Window

Detects a burst of Microsoft 365 user account lockouts within a short 5-minute window. A high number of IdsLocked login errors across multiple user accounts may indicate brute-force attempts for the same users resulting in lockouts.

This rule uses ES|QL aggregations and thus has dynamically generated fields. Correlation of the values in the alert document may need to be performed to the original sign-in and Graph events for further context.

### Investigation Steps

- Review the `user_id_list`: Are specific naming patterns targeted (e.g., admin, helpdesk)?
- Examine `ip_list` and `source_orgs`: Look for suspicious ISPs or hosting providers.
- Check `duration_seconds`: A very short window with a high lockout rate often indicates automation.
- Confirm lockout policy thresholds with IAM or Entra ID admins. Did the policy trigger correctly?
- Use the `first_seen` and `last_seen` values to pivot into related authentication or audit logs.
- Correlate with any recent detection of password spraying or credential stuffing activity.
- Review the `request_type` field to identify which authentication methods were used (e.g., OAuth, SAML, etc.).
- Check for any successful logins from the same IP or ASN after the lockouts.

### False Positive Analysis

- Automated systems with stale credentials may cause repeated failed logins.
- Legitimate bulk provisioning or scripted tests could unintentionally cause account lockouts.
- Red team exercises or penetration tests may resemble the same lockout pattern.
- Some organizations may have a high volume of lockouts due to user behavior or legacy systems.

### Response Recommendations

- Notify affected users and confirm whether activity was expected or suspicious.
- Lock or reset credentials for impacted accounts.
- Block the source IP(s) or ASN temporarily using conditional access or firewall rules.
- Strengthen lockout and retry delay policies if necessary.
- Review the originating application(s) involved via `request_types`.
