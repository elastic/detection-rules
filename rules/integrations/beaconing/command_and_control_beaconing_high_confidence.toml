The rule requires the Network Beaconing Identification integration assets to be installed, as well as network logs collected by the Elastic Defend or Network Packet Capture integrations.

### Network Beaconing Identification Setup
The Network Beaconing Identification integration consists of a statistical framework to identify C2 beaconing activity in network logs.

#### Prerequisite Requirements:
- Fleet is required for Network Beaconing Identification.
- To configure Fleet Server refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-server.html).
- Network events collected by the [Elastic Defend](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/endpoint) or [Network Packet Capture](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/network_traffic) integration.
- To install Elastic Defend, refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/install-endpoint.html).
- To add the Network Packet Capture integration to an Elastic Agent policy, refer to [this](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/add-integration-to-policy.html) guide.

#### The following steps should be executed to install assets associated with the Network Beaconing Identification integration:
- Go to the Kibana homepage. Under Management, click Integrations.
- In the query bar, search for Network Beaconing Identification and select the integration to see more details about it.
- Follow the instructions under the **Installation** section.

### Investigating Statistical Model Detected C2 Beaconing Activity with High Confidence

Statistical models analyze network traffic patterns to identify anomalies indicative of C2 beaconing, a tactic where attackers maintain covert communication with compromised systems. Adversaries exploit this to issue commands, exfiltrate data, and sustain network presence. The detection rule leverages a high beaconing score to flag potential threats, aiding analysts in pinpointing suspicious activities linked to C2 operations.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the network traffic logs to identify the source and destination IP addresses associated with the beaconing activity flagged by the beacon_stats.beaconing_score of 3.
- Correlate the identified IP addresses with known malicious IP databases or threat intelligence feeds to determine if they are associated with known C2 servers.
- Analyze the frequency and pattern of the beaconing activity to assess whether it aligns with typical C2 communication patterns, such as regular intervals or specific time frames.
- Investigate the domain names involved in the communication to check for any associations with malicious activities or suspicious registrations.
- Examine the payloads or data transferred during the flagged communication sessions to identify any potential exfiltration of sensitive information or receipt of malicious instructions.
- Cross-reference the involved systems with internal asset inventories to determine if they are critical assets or have been previously flagged for suspicious activities.
- Consult with the incident response team to decide on containment or remediation actions if the investigation confirms malicious C2 activity.

### False positive analysis

- Regularly scheduled software updates or patch management systems may generate network traffic patterns similar to C2 beaconing. Users can create exceptions for known update servers to reduce false positives.
- Automated backup systems that frequently communicate with cloud storage services might be flagged. Identifying and excluding these backup services from the analysis can help mitigate this issue.
- Network monitoring tools that periodically check connectivity or system health can mimic beaconing activity. Whitelisting these monitoring tools can prevent them from being incorrectly flagged.
- Internal applications that use polling mechanisms to check for updates or status changes may trigger alerts. Documenting and excluding these applications from the rule can minimize false positives.
- Frequent communication with trusted third-party services, such as content delivery networks, may appear as beaconing. Establishing a list of trusted domains and excluding them from the analysis can help manage this.

### Response and remediation

- Isolate the affected systems from the network to prevent further communication with the C2 server and contain the threat.
- Conduct a thorough analysis of the network traffic logs to identify any additional compromised systems or lateral movement within the network.
- Remove any malicious software or scripts identified on the compromised systems, ensuring all traces of the C2 communication channels are eradicated.
- Apply security patches and updates to all affected systems to close any vulnerabilities exploited by the attackers.
- Change all credentials and authentication tokens associated with the compromised systems to prevent unauthorized access.
- Monitor the network for any signs of re-infection or continued C2 activity, using enhanced detection rules and updated threat intelligence.
- Escalate the incident to the appropriate internal security team or external cybersecurity experts for further investigation and to assess the potential impact on the organization."""
