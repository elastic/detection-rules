The rule requires the Network Beaconing Identification integration assets to be installed, as well as network logs collected by the Elastic Defend or Network Packet Capture integrations.

### Network Beaconing Identification Setup
The Network Beaconing Identification integration consists of a statistical framework to identify C2 beaconing activity in network logs.

#### Prerequisite Requirements:
- Fleet is required for Network Beaconing Identification.
- To configure Fleet Server refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-server.html).
- Network events collected by the [Elastic Defend](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/endpoint) or [Network Packet Capture](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/network_traffic) integration.
- To install Elastic Defend, refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/install-endpoint.html).
- To add the Network Packet Capture integration to an Elastic Agent policy, refer to [this](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/add-integration-to-policy.html) guide.

#### The following steps should be executed to install assets associated with the Network Beaconing Identification integration:
- Go to the Kibana homepage. Under Management, click Integrations.
- In the query bar, search for Network Beaconing Identification and select the integration to see more details about it.
- Follow the instructions under the **Installation** section.
