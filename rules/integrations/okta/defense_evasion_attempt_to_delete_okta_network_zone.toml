### Investigating Attempt to Delete an Okta Network Zone

Okta network zones can be configured to limit or restrict access to a network based on IP addresses or geolocations. Deleting a network zone in Okta might remove or weaken the security controls of an organization, which might be an indicator of an adversary's attempt to evade defenses.

#### Possible investigation steps:

- Identify the actor associated with the alert by examining the `okta.actor.id`, `okta.actor.type`, `okta.actor.alternate_id`, or `okta.actor.display_name` fields.
- Examine the `event.action` field to confirm the deletion of a network zone.
- Investigate the `okta.target.id`, `okta.target.type`, `okta.target.alternate_id`, or `okta.target.display_name` fields to identify the network zone that was deleted.
- Review the `event.time` field to understand when the event happened.
- Check the actor's activities before and after the event to understand the context of this event.

### False positive analysis:

- Verify the `okta.client.user_agent.raw_user_agent` field to understand the device and software used by the actor. If these match the actor's typical behavior, it might be a false positive.
- Check if the actor is a known administrator or a member of the IT team who might have a legitimate reason to delete a network zone.
- Cross-verify the actor's actions with any known planned changes or maintenance activities.

### Response and remediation:

- If unauthorized access or actions are confirmed, immediately lock the affected actor's account and require a password change.
- If a network zone was deleted without authorization, create a new network zone with similar settings as the deleted one.
- Review and update the privileges of the actor who initiated the deletion.
- Identify any gaps in the security policies and procedures and update them as necessary.
- Implement additional monitoring and logging of Okta events to improve visibility of user actions.
- Communicate and train the employees about the importance of following proper procedures for modifying network zone settings.

## Setup

The Okta Fleet integration, Filebeat module, or similarly structured data is required to be compatible with this rule."""
