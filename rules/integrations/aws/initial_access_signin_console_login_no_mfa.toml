Identifies when a federated user logs into the AWS Management Console without using multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Federated users are typically given temporary credentials to access AWS services. If a federated user logs into the AWS
Management Console without using MFA, it may indicate a security risk, as MFA adds an additional layer of security to
the authentication process. This could also indicate the abuse of STS tokens to bypass MFA requirements.
