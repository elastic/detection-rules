### Investigating AWS SQS Queue Purge

This rule detects when an AWS SQS queue is purged, an action that adversaries may use to disrupt operations, delete messages, or impair monitoring and alerting mechanisms. Purging an SQS queue removes all messages, which could be used as a tactic to evade detection by deleting evidence of malicious activity or to disrupt legitimate workflows.

#### Possible Investigation Steps

- **Identify the Actor and Resource**:
  - **User Identity and Permissions**: Review the field `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` to identify the IAM user or role responsible for the purge. Validate their permissions and determine if this action aligns with their typical responsibilities.
  - **SQS Queue Details**: Examine `aws.cloudtrail.resources.arn` and `aws.cloudtrail.flattened.request_parameters.queueUrl` to identify the specific SQS queue that was purged. Check its purpose, associated workflows, and whether it handles sensitive or critical messages.

- **Evaluate the Context and Purpose of the Purge**:
  - **Time and Frequency**: Check the timestamp (`@timestamp`) to determine when the purge occurred and whether similar events have occurred recently. Frequent or repeated purges may indicate a larger issue or ongoing malicious activity.
  - **Legitimacy of the Action**: Consult with the owner or administrator of the affected queue to verify if the purge was intentional or authorized.

- **Analyze for Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity**:
  - **Source IP and Geographic Location**: Review `source.ip` and `source.geo` to identify the origin of the request. Anomalies, such as unexpected locations, may indicate compromise.
  - **User Agent and Tooling**: Check `user_agent.original` to confirm the tool used to perform the purge. The use of unexpected or automated tooling may raise suspicion.

- **Cross-Reference Related Activity**:
  - **Recent IAM Events**: Search for related IAM or security-related events tied to the same actor, such as `CreateAccessKey`, `AssumeRole`, or `UpdateRolePolicy`, which could indicate privilege escalation or preparation for malicious actions.
  - **Other SQS Activity**: Look for additional activity involving the same SQS queue, such as `SendMessage`, `ReceiveMessage`, or `DeleteQueue`, to identify further signs of unauthorized usage.

### False Positive Analysis

- **Legitimate Administrative Activity**: Administrators may purge SQS queues as part of maintenance or cleanup processes. Validate whether the action was part of an approved operation.
- **Automation or Testing**: Automation tools or testing processes may perform queue purges as part of their workflow. Verify if the action aligns with known automated tasks or test scenarios.

### Response and Remediation

- **Immediate Actions**:
  - **Restrict Access**: If the action appears unauthorized, immediately revoke access for the actor responsible for the purge and investigate potential credential compromise.
  - **Restore Data**: If the purged queue contained critical or sensitive messages, attempt to restore them from backups if available.

- **Preventative Measures**:
  - **Enhance Monitoring**: Enable additional monitoring for SQS-related activity to detect unusual patterns, such as frequent purges or changes to queue configurations.
  - **Audit Permissions**: Review and restrict IAM permissions for SQS to ensure only authorized users or roles can perform sensitive actions like `PurgeQueue`.

- **Policy Updates**:
  - **Apply Least Privilege**: Adjust IAM policies to enforce the principle of least privilege, ensuring that only necessary permissions are granted. Review the policy assigned to the SQS queue as well to prevent unauthorized purges.
  - **MFA Enforcement**: Require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users with access to sensitive AWS resources.
