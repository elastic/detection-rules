### Investigating AWS CLI with Kali Linux Fingerprint Identified

The `user_agent.original` field in AWS CloudTrail logs reveals the operating system and toolchain used to make API calls. The substring `distrib#kali` strongly implies the use of Kali Linux, a common OS used by offensive security professionals and adversaries.

#### Possible Investigation Steps

- Identify the User: Check `user.name`, `user.arn`, and `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.*` to determine which IAM identity was used.
- Review Access Pattern: Correlate API calls from this user agent with sensitive actions such as `PutObject`, `CreateUser`, `AttachUserPolicy`, etc.
- Investigate Source IP: Examine whether the request originated from an expected network or a suspicious VPN or cloud provider address.
- Check for Initial Access: Look for session tokens being issued (e.g., `GetSessionToken`) or reused (`AssumeRole`) prior to this event.

### False Positive Analysis

- Rare but possible in security assessments or internal red teaming. Validate the action context (user, IP, time of day, etc).

### Response and Remediation

- Revoke Credentials: If unauthorized, revoke keys or sessions immediately.
- Harden IAM Policies: Restrict sensitive IAM privileges, especially if used by CI/CD or automation roles.
- Alert on Repeat Usage: Add recurring monitoring for suspicious user agents including `kali`, `curl`, or known toolkits.
