## Triage and Analysis

### Investigating AWS S3 Object Versioning Suspended

This rule detects when object versioning for an S3 bucket is suspended. Adversaries with access to a misconfigured S3 bucket may disable object versioning prior to replacing or deleting S3 objects, inhibiting recovery initiatives.
This rule uses [EQL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/rules-ui-create.html#create-eql-rule) to look for use of the `PutBucketVersioning` operation where the `request_parameters` include `Status=Suspended`.

#### Possible Investigation Steps:

- **Identify the Actor**: Review the `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` and `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` fields to identify who performed the action. Verify if this actor typically performs such actions and if they have the necessary permissions.
- **Analyze the Source of the Request**: Investigate the `source.ip` and `source.geo` fields to determine the geographical origin of the request. An external or unexpected location might indicate compromised credentials or unauthorized access.
- **Correlate with Other Activities**: Search for related CloudTrail events before and after this action to see if the same actor or IP address engaged in other potentially suspicious activities.
- **Check for Object Deletion or Access**: Look for `DeleteObject`, `DeleteObjects`, or `GetObject` API calls to the same S3 bucket that may indicate the adversary accessing and destroying objects including older object versions.
- **Interview Relevant Personnel**: If the copy event was initiated by a user, verify the intent and authorization for this action with the person or team responsible for managing S3 buckets.

### False Positive Analysis:

- **Legitimate Administrative Actions**: Confirm if the action aligns with legitimate administrative tasks documented in change management systems.
- **Consistency Check**: Compare the action against historical data of similar activities performed by the user or within the organization. If the action is consistent with past legitimate activities, it might indicate a false alarm.

### Response and Remediation:

- **Immediate Review**: If the activity was unauthorized, search for replaced or deleted objects and review the bucket's access logs for any suspicious activity.
- **Educate and Train**: Provide additional training to users with administrative rights on the importance of security best practices concerning S3 bucket management and the risks of ransomware.
- **Audit S3 Bucket Policies and Permissions**: Conduct a comprehensive audit of all S3 bucket policies and associated permissions to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege.
- **Incident Response**: If there's an indication of malicious intent or a security breach, initiate the incident response protocol to mitigate any damage and prevent future occurrences.

### Additional Information:

For further guidance on managing S3 bucket security and protecting against ransomware, refer to the [AWS S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) and AWS best practices for security.
