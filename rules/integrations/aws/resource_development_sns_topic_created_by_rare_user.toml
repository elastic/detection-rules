### Investigating AWS SNS Topic Created by Rare User

This rule detects the creation of an AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic by a user who does not typically perform this action. Adversaries may create SNS topics to facilitate data exfiltration or other malicious activities.

This is a [New Terms](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/rules-ui-create.html#create-new-terms-rule) rule that only flags when this behavior is observed for the first time on a host in the last 10 days.

#### Possible Investigation Steps

### 1. Identify the Actor and Context
- **User Identity and Role**:
  - Examine `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` to determine **who** created the SNS topic.
  - Identify whether the actor assumed a **privileged IAM role** (`aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.type: "AssumedRole"`).
- **User Agent and Tooling**:
  - Check `user_agent.name` to determine if this action was performed via the AWS CLI, SDK, or Console.
  - If `aws-cli` was used, review whether it aligns with typical automation or administrative behavior.
- **Source IP and Geographic Location**:
  - Review `source.ip` and `source.geo` fields to confirm if the request originated from a **trusted** or **unexpected** location.

### 2. Evaluate the SNS Topic Creation
- **Topic Name and Purpose**:
  - Check `aws.cloudtrail.flattened.request_parameters.name` for the **SNS topic name** and determine whether it appears suspicious (e.g., random strings, unusual keywords).
- **Target Region and Account**:
  - Verify `cloud.region` and `cloud.account.id` to **ensure the SNS topic was created in an expected environment**.
- **Associated API Calls**:
  - Identify additional actions **before or after** this event using `event.action` values like:
    - `Subscribe`
    - `Publish`
    - `SetTopicAttributes`
  - These may indicate follow-up steps taken to misuse the SNS topic.

### 3. Analyze Potential Malicious Intent
- **Is This an Isolated Action or a Pattern?**
  - Check if this **user has previously created SNS topics** using historical CloudTrail logs.
  - Look for **multiple topic creations in a short period**, which may suggest an automation script or malicious behavior.
- **Unusual Role Usage**:
  - If `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` references an **EC2 instance role**, verify whether that instance typically performs SNS operations.
- **Potential Data Exfiltration or Persistence**:
  - Review whether **new subscriptions** were added (`Subscribe` API action) to forward data externally.
  - If an SNS topic was configured to trigger **Lambda functions or S3 events**, it may indicate an attempt to persist in the environment.

## False Positive Analysis
- **Legitimate Usage of SNS**:
  - SNS is commonly used for **event-driven notifications** in AWS.
  - Check whether the SNS topic creation aligns with known **DevOps, automation, or monitoring activities**.
- **Routine IAM Role Activity**:
  - If the user typically interacts with SNS, consider **allowlisting** expected IAM roles for this action.
- **AWS Services Creating Topics Automatically**:
  - Some AWS services may **auto-create SNS topics** for alerts and monitoring. Confirm whether the creation was system-generated.

## Response and Remediation
- **Confirm Authorization**:
  - If the user was not expected to create SNS topics, verify whether their IAM permissions should be restricted.
- **Revoke Unauthorized Access**:
  - If unauthorized, disable the access keys or IAM role associated with the event.
- **Monitor for Further SNS Modifications**:
  - Set up additional monitoring for **SNS Publish or Subscription events** (`Publish`, `Subscribe`).
- **Enhance IAM Policy Controls**:
  - Consider enforcing **least privilege** IAM policies and enabling **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** where applicable.
- **Investigate for Persistence**:
  - Check whether the SNS topic is **being used as a notification channel for Lambda, S3, or other AWS services**.
