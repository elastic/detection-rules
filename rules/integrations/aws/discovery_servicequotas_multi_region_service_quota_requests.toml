Identifies when a single AWS resource is making `GetServiceQuota` API calls for the EC2 service quota L-1216C47A in more
than 10 regions within a 30-second window. Quota code L-1216C47A represents on-demand instances which are used by
adversaries to deploy malware and mine cryptocurrency. This could indicate a potential threat actor attempting to
discover the AWS infrastructure across multiple regions using compromised credentials or a compromised instance.
