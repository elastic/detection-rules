Identifies role chaining activity. Role chaining is when you use one assumed role to assume a second role through the AWS CLI or API. 
While this a recognized functionality in AWS, role chaining can be abused for privilege escalation if the subsequent assumed role provides additional privileges. 
Role chaining can also be used as a persistence mechanism as each AssumeRole action results in a refreshed session token with a 1 hour maximum duration.
This rule looks for role chaining activity happening within a single account, to eliminate false positives produced by common cross-account behavior.
