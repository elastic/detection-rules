### Investigating Potential AWS S3 Bucket Ransomware Note Uploaded

This rule detects a successful `PutObject` to S3 where the object key matches common ransomware-note patterns (for example, `readme`, `how_to_decrypt`, `decrypt_instructions`, `ransom`, `lock`). Attackers who obtain credentials or abuse overly-permissive bucket policies can upload ransom notes (often after deleting or encrypting data).

#### Possible Investigation Steps:
- **Confirm the actor and session details.** Review `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.*` (ARN, type, access key, session context), `source.ip`, `user.agent`, and `tls.client.server_name` to identify *who* performed the upload and *from where*. Validate whether this principal typically writes to this bucket. 
- **Inspect the object key and bucket context.** From `aws.cloudtrail.request_parameters`, capture the exact `key` and `bucketName`. Check whether the key is publicly readable (ACL), whether the bucket is internet-exposed, and whether replication or lifecycle rules could propagate or remove related objects. 
- **Pivot to related S3 activity around the same time.** Look for `DeleteObject`/`DeleteObjects`, mass `PutObject` spikes, `PutBucketPolicy`, `PutPublicAccessBlock`, `PutBucketVersioning`, and `PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration` events on the same bucket or by the same actor to determine if data destruction, policy tampering, or guard-rail changes occurred. 
- **Assess blast radius across the account.** Search recent CloudTrail for the same actor/IP touching other buckets, KMS keys used by those buckets, and IAM changes (new access keys, policy attachments, role assumptions) that could indicate broader compromise paths consistent with ransomware playbooks. 
- **Check protections and recovery posture on the bucket.** Verify whether S3 Versioning and (if in use) Object Lock legal hold are enabled; note prior versions available for the affected key, and whether lifecycle rules might expire them. 
- **Correlate with threat signals.** Review other related alerts, GuardDuty S3-related findings, AWS Config drift on the bucket and its policy, and any SOAR/IR runbook executions tied to ransomware triage. 

### False Positive Analysis:
- **Planned tests or red-team exercises.** Confirm change tickets or test windows for staging/dev buckets; red teams often drop “ransom-note-like” files during exercises. 
- **Benign automation naming.** Some data-migration or backup tools may use “readme”/“recovery”-style filenames; validate by `user.agent`, principal, and target environment (dev vs prod). 
- **Log/archive buckets.** Exclude infrastructure/logging buckets (for example, `AWSLogs`, CloudTrail, access logs) per rule guidance to reduce noise. 

### Response and Remediation:

**1. Immediate, low-risk actions (safe for most environments)**
- **Preserve context:** Export the triggering `PutObject` CloudTrail record(s), plus 15–30 min before/after, to an evidence bucket (restricted access). 
- **Snapshot configuration:** Record current bucket settings (Block Public Access, Versioning, Object Lock, Bucket Policy, Lifecycle rules) and any KMS keys used.
- **Quiet the spread:** Pause destructive automation: disable/bypass lifecycle rules that would expire/delete object versions; temporarily pause data pipelines targeting the bucket.
- **Notify owners:** Inform the bucket/application owner(s) and security leadership.

**2. Containment options (choose the least disruptive first)**
- **Harden exposure:** If not already enforced, enable `Block Public Access` for the bucket.
- **Targeted deny policy (temporary):** Add a restrictive bucket policy allowing only IR/admin roles while you scope impact. Reconfirm critical workload dependencies before applying.
- **Credential risk reduction:** If a specific IAM user/key or role is implicated, rotate access keys; for roles, remove risky policy attachments or temporarily restrict with an SCP/deny statement.

**3. Evidence preservation**
- Export relevant CloudTrail events, S3 server/access logs (if enabled), AWS Config history for the bucket/policy, and the suspicious object plus its previous versions (if Versioning is enabled).
- Document actor ARN, source IPs, user agent(s), exact `bucketName`/`key`, and timestamps. Maintain a simple chain-of-custody note for collected artifacts.

**4. Scope and hunting (same actor/time window)**
- Look for `DeleteObject(s)`, unusual `PutObject` volume, `PutBucketPolicy`, `PutPublicAccessBlock`, `PutBucketVersioning` changes, `PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration`, and cross-account access.
- Cross reference other buckets touched by the same actor/IP; recent IAM changes (new keys, policy/role edits); GuardDuty findings tied to S3/credentials.

**5. Recovery (prioritize data integrity)**
- If Versioning is enabled, restore last known-good versions for impacted objects. Consider applying Object Lock legal hold to clean versions during recovery if configured.
- If Versioning is not enabled, recover from backups (AWS Backup, replication targets). Enable Versioning going forward on critical buckets; evaluate Object Lock for high-value data.
- Carefully remove any temporary deny policy only after credentials are rotated, policies re-validated, and no ongoing destructive activity is observed.

**6. Post-incident hardening**
- Enforce `Block Public Access`, enable Versioning (and MFA-Delete where appropriate), and review bucket policies for least privilege.
- Ensure continuous CloudTrail data events for S3 are enabled in covered regions; enable/verify GuardDuty S3 protections and alerts routing.
- Add detections for related behaviors (policy tampering, bulk deletes, versioning/lifecycle toggles) and create allowlists for known maintenance windows.

**7. Communication & escalation**
- If you have an IR team/provider: escalate with the evidence bundle and a summary (bucket/key, actor, protections, related activity, business impact).
- If you do not have an IR team: designate an internal incident lead, track actions/time, and follow these steps conservatively. Favor reversible controls (temporary deny, key rotation) over invasive changes.
