### Investigating AWS CloudWatch Log Group Deletion

CloudWatch Logs is foundational to AWS observability, SIEM ingestion, audit pipelines, and incident response.  
Log groups often contain retention-critical logs such as:

- VPC Flow Logs  
- Lambda function logs  
- Application and container logs  
- Security service logs (e.g., AWS WAF, RDS logs)

Deletion of a log group removes all historical log streams and cannot be reversed. 
Adversaries may leverage `DeleteLogGroup` to impair forensic visibility, disrupt monitoring, and hide evidence following malicious actions. This rule detects a successful `DeleteLogGroup` event initiated from a non–AWS Internal user agent, signalling potential defense evasion or disruption of logging pipelines.

#### Possible investigation steps

 **Identify the actor**
- Review `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` and `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id`.  
- Determine whether this identity normally modifies CloudWatch Logs or is associated with automation.

**Review deletion details**
- Inspect `aws.cloudtrail.request_parameters` to determine the exact log group deleted.  
- Assess whether the log group provided visibility into:
  - CloudTrail processing,  
  - Network flows (VPC Flow Logs),  
  - Serverless/application security logs,  
  - Lambda, ECS, EKS, or container workload logs.

**Check source and context**
- Assess `source.ip` for unusual IPs, geolocations, VPN endpoints, or cloud provider ranges unfamiliar to your environment.  
- Review `user_agent.original` for unexpected tools (custom agents, unusual SDKs, attackers using CLI default agents).

**Correlate with surrounding activity**
Look for preceding or subsequent CloudTrail events such as:

- `StopLogging`, `DeleteTrail`, or CloudTrail configuration changes  
- IAM permission escalations (e.g., `PutUserPolicy`, `AttachRolePolicy`)  
- Security service suppression actions (e.g., GuardDuty detector deletion)  
- Lambda or application configuration updates that may indicate a compromise  

If the deleted log group was associated with a Lambda execution role, review for suspicious code updates or rogue deployments.

**Assess business or security impact**
- Identify whether the deleted log group fed:
  - SIEM ingestion  
  - Security analytics pipelines  
  - Compliance/audit logs  
  - Operational monitoring or alerting  
- Contact the service owner or development team to verify whether the deletion was intentional.

**Determine compromise scope if malicious**
- Use CloudTrail to identify prior activity by the same user identity or IP.  
- Examine authentication events (IAM, STS) for signs of stolen credentials or session hijacking.  
- Identify resources or applications dependent on the deleted logging pipeline.

### False positive analysis

- **IaC-managed environments**: Tools like Terraform or CloudFormation may delete and recreate log groups during deployments.  
- **Automated cleanup jobs**: Some environments use automated retention cleanup workflows.  
- **Ephemeral testing accounts**: Development/testing accounts frequently create and destroy log groups.

To tune noise:
- Add exceptions for specific automation IAM roles or trusted source IPs.
- Require `user_agent.original` and `source.ip` conditions for baseline-based tuning.

### Response and remediation

**Containment**
- Immediately recreate the deleted log group (if appropriate) using IaC or CloudWatch Console.  
- Restrict the IAM identity that performed the deletion until the activity is validated.  
- Enable or confirm CloudTrail logging in all regions to maintain broader visibility.

**Investigation**
- Review CloudTrail activity for:
  - privilege escalation attempts,  
  - IAM role modifications,  
  - security service tampering (CloudTrail, Config, GuardDuty).  
- Correlate with alerts from other services (GuardDuty, Security Hub, SIEM detections).

**Recovery and hardening**
- Enforce least privilege on `logs:DeleteLogGroup`.  
- Configure AWS Config rules to alert on missing or modified log groups.  
- Implement log group retention policies and IAM SCP guardrails to prevent unauthorized deletion.  
- Document log group ownership and expected lifecycle management.
