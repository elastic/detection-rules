### Investigating AWS EC2 Multi-Region DescribeInstances API Calls

This rule detects instances where a single AWS resource makes `DescribeInstances` API calls in over 10 regions within a 30-second window. This could indicate an adversary using compromised credentials or an exploited resource to enumerate AWS infrastructure across multiple regions. Attackers often leverage multi-region enumeration to assess the overall cloud environment and find potential targets for further exploitation.

#### Possible Investigation Steps

- **Identify the Resource and Actor**:
  - **Actor ARN**: Check `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` to determine the exact identity performing the enumeration. Validate if the user is expected to perform region-wide `DescribeInstances` actions across multiple regions or if it seems unusual.
  - **Account and Role Details**: Examine `cloud.account.id` and `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.session_context.session_issuer` for information about the AWS account and specific role associated with the action.

- **Analyze API Call Patterns**:
  - **Frequency and Scope**: Review `cloud.region` field and confirm if this specific resource commonly performs `DescribeInstances` calls across multiple regions.
  - **Time Window Context**: Compare the timing of the API calls within the `target_time_window` to determine if this burst pattern aligns with expected system usage or is potentially malicious.

- **Check User Agent and Tooling**:
  - **Source and User Agent**: Verify `user_agent.original` to determine if the request was made through expected tooling (e.g., AWS CLI or SDK) or a third-party tool that might indicate non-standard access.
  - **Source IP Address**: Look into `source.address` to identify the origin of the calls. Unusual IP addresses, especially those outside expected ranges, may indicate compromised access.

- **Evaluate for Potential Reconnaissance Behavior**:
  - **Account and Region Enumeration**: Adversaries may use region-wide `DescribeInstances` requests to discover resources within an account across different regions. Confirm if this access aligns with operational practices or represents excessive access.
  - **Permissions and Roles**: Investigate the permissions associated with the user role. Excessive permissions on a compromised role may allow broader enumeration, which should be restricted.

- **Review Related CloudTrail Events**:
  - **Additional Describe or List Actions**: Identify any associated `Describe` or `List` API calls that may indicate further enumeration of other AWS services within the same timeframe.
  - **Potential Preceding Events**: Look for preceding login or access events from the same actor, as these may indicate potential credential compromise or unauthorized escalation of privileges.

### False Positive Analysis

- **Expected Enumeration**: Certain administrative or automation scripts may conduct broad `DescribeInstances` API calls for inventory purposes. Review usage patterns or consult relevant teams to validate the purpose.
- **Automated Cloud Management**: Some automated services may perform regional checks for compliance or backup operations. If this rule is triggered repeatedly by a known service, consider whitelisting or tuning accordingly.

### Response and Remediation

- **Review IAM Policies and Role Permissions**: Limit the permissions of roles associated with this resource, restricting unnecessary multi-region enumeration access.
- **Enforce Least Privilege Access**: Ensure that permissions for DescribeInstances are tightly controlled and restricted to specific roles or accounts that require multi-region access.
- **Increase Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up additional monitoring on this role or account for further signs of unauthorized activity or lateral movement attempts.
- **Access Review**: Conduct a review of users and entities with `DescribeInstances` permissions, especially for multi-region capabilities, and ensure these permissions are necessary for their functions.
