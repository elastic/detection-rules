### Investigating AWS IAM Virtual MFA Device Registration Attempt with Session Token

AWS temporary security credentials that begin with `ASIA` indicate they are session tokens. An attempt to create or enable a Virtual MFA device using such credentials is uncommon and may indicate malicious activity.

#### Possible Investigation Steps

- **Identify the User**: Check `user.name`, `user.arn`, and `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.*` fields to determine which IAM entity made the request.
- **Check for Prior Reconnaissance or Access**: Correlate this event with any prior calls to `GetSessionToken`, `GetCallerIdentity`, or `ListUsers` to see if an adversary was enumerating IAM users.
- **Source Context**: Review `source.ip`, `user_agent`, and `event.origin` to determine whether this came from a legitimate device or a suspicious endpoint (e.g., Kali, Mythic, unknown VPN).
- **Validate MFA Setup**: Look for follow-up attempts to call `sts:get-session-token` or `iam:EnableMFADevice` using this same session.

### False Positive Analysis

- This may occur if an admin or automation tool is legitimately setting up a new MFA device using temporary credentials.
- Review the IP, agent, and context to differentiate expected automation from unauthorized access.

### Response and Remediation

- **Revoke Credentials**: If unauthorized, revoke the access keys or terminate the session.
- **Reset MFA and Passwords**: Rotate credentials for the affected IAM user.
- **Review IAM Policies**: Limit permissions to register MFA devices to trusted roles only.
- **Enable CloudTrail Alerts**: Monitor IAM changes more broadly with CloudTrail-based alerts.
