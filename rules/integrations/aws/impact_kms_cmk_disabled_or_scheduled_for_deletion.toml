Identifies attempts to disable or schedule the deletion of an AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK). Deleting an AWS KMS
key is destructive and potentially dangerous. It deletes the key material and all metadata associated with the KMS key
and is irreversible. After a KMS key is deleted, the data that was encrypted under that KMS key can no longer be
decrypted, which means that data becomes unrecoverable.
