The rule requires the Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) Detection integration assets to be installed, as well as DNS events collected by integrations such as Elastic Defend, Network Packet Capture, or Packetbeat.  

### DGA Detection Setup
The DGA Detection integration consists of an ML-based framework to detect DGA activity in DNS events.

#### Prerequisite Requirements:
- Fleet is required for DGA Detection.
- To configure Fleet Server refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-server.html).
- DNS events collected by the [Elastic Defend](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/endpoint), [Network Packet Capture](https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/network_traffic) integration, or [Packetbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/packetbeat/current/packetbeat-overview.html).
- To install Elastic Defend, refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/install-endpoint.html).
- To add the Network Packet Capture integration to an Elastic Agent policy, refer to [this](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/add-integration-to-policy.html) guide.
- To set up and run Packetbeat, follow [this](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/packetbeat/current/setting-up-and-running.html) guide.

#### The following steps should be executed to install assets associated with the DGA Detection integration:
- Go to the Kibana homepage. Under Management, click Integrations.
- In the query bar, search for Domain Generation Algorithm Detection and select the integration to see more details about it.
- Follow the instructions under the **Installation** section.
- For this rule to work, complete the instructions through **Configure the ingest pipeline**.
