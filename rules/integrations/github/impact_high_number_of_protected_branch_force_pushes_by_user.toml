### Investigating High Number of Protected Branch Force Pushes by User

This rule flags a single user performing many force pushes to protected branches in a short window, signaling aggressive history rewrites on critical repositories. Such activity can erase commits, hide unauthorized changes, and disrupt builds or releases, indicating potential data destruction or sabotage. Example: a compromised maintainer acquires elevated access and repeatedly force-pushes rewritten history to the main branch to purge prior commits, remove security fixes, and introduce a backdoor while bypassing merge protections.

### Possible investigation steps

- Verify the user's current and recent org/repo roles and bypass permissions, along with any recent elevation, SSO changes, or new PAT/GitHub App installations linked to the account.
- Enumerate impacted repositories and protected branches, then reconstruct the overwritten history by comparing before/after SHAs from audit logs or local mirrors to determine what commits were removed or rewritten.
- Assess intent and legitimacy by contacting repo owners and checking change tickets or maintenance windows for planned history rewrites, and suspend override permissions if unplanned while preserving forensic evidence.
- Analyze sign-in and authentication telemetry around the events (IP, geo, MFA status, device, OAuth/PAT/App identifiers, off-hours) to spot account compromise indicators and pivot to other activity by the same token.
- Review diffs of the resulting branch heads and CI/CD artifacts to detect malicious changes (e.g., removed security fixes, inserted secrets/backdoors), and check for anomalous releases or workflows triggered by the rewritten commits.

### False positive analysis

- An authorized maintainer conducts a planned history rewrite (rebases/resets to remove problematic commits) across protected branches in multiple repositories, legitimately invoking policy overrides and issuing many force pushes in quick succession.
- A release owner executes an emergency rollback by resetting protected branches to a known-good commit across several repositories, causing repeated, intentional force pushes and protected-branch overrides.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately contain by removing the user from repo admin/maintain teams, revoking all active PATs/OAuth/App tokens linked to the account, and updating branch protection on affected branches to disallow force pushes and restrict pushes to a small trusted group.
- Freeze each impacted protected branch by creating an annotated tag at the last known-good commit SHA prior to the force pushes and temporarily pausing CI/CD workflows that build from those branch heads.
- Recover by restoring each branch head to the last known-good commit or signed tag from a trusted mirror/backup, verifying the target SHA, and re-enabling protections and required status checks after integrity confirmation.
- Eradicate unauthorized changes by diffing the pre-override and post-override branch heads, reverting malicious edits, rotating repository secrets referenced in code/workflows, and removing suspicious GitHub Apps installed by the user.
- Escalate to incident response and legal if any overwritten history includes production release branches or signed tags, if the user denies authorization, or if pushes originated from a new token/App unknown to repo owners.
- Harden by enforcing rulesets that block force pushes and require linear history on main and release/* branches, enabling CODEOWNERS-required reviews and signed commits, limiting bypass permissions to a small admin group, and using deploy keys or CI bots with short-lived tokens for pushes.
