### Investigating GitHub Exfiltration via High Number of Repository Clones by User

This rule flags a single user rapidly cloning dozens of repositories, a strong indicator of bulk source code exfiltration. Mass cloning enables quick siphoning of proprietary code, embedded secrets, and build artifacts across teams before defenses can respond. A typical pattern is a stolen personal access token used in a script to enumerate org repositories and clone them in rapid succession from a CI runner or cloud VM, including private and internal repos, to stage data for off-platform transfer.

### Possible investigation steps

- Validate whether the actor is a known automation or service account with a documented need to mass-clone, and quickly confirm intent with the account owner and affected repo admins.
- Enumerate the cloned repositories and their visibility, deprioritizing activity dominated by public repos while fast-tracking private/internal codebases with sensitive content across orgs.
- Pivot on the token identifier to determine the token owner, scopes, and creation/last-use details, compare to normal usage patterns, and revoke/reset credentials if anomalous.
- Analyze the user agent and agent identifier to attribute the activity to a specific host or CI runner, correlating with pipeline logs and login locations/times for anomalies.
- Correlate with endpoint/network telemetry from the originating host for large outbound transfers, external Git remotes, or bulk archiving indicating off-platform exfiltration following the clones.

### False positive analysis

- A developer rebuilding a workstation or creating an approved local mirror may legitimately clone dozens of repositories in a short window, especially when activity is dominated by public or low-sensitivity repos.
- A shared automation/service account running scheduled builds or org-wide maintenance tasks can trigger fresh clones across many repositories due to pipeline configuration or cache resets, inflating counts without exfiltration intent.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately revoke the GitHub token used for the clones, force sign out, require password reset and 2FA re-verification for the user, and suspend the account if unauthorized.
- Block and quarantine the originating host or CI runner by revoking its runner registration, removing its SSH keys/credentials, and firewalling its IP until imaged.
- On the cloned private/internal repositories, remove the user from teams, rotate or disable deploy keys and GitHub App installations, and enforce SAML SSO.
- Rotate repository and organization secrets present in those repos (Actions secrets, PATs, SSH keys, cloud access keys) and invalidate any secrets found in commit history.
- Recover by restoring only minimal access after owner approval, issuing a new fine-grained PAT with least privilege and expiry, and re-enabling builds while monitoring for further clone bursts.
- Escalate to incident response leadership and Legal if any private or export-controlled repos were cloned or cloning continues post-revocation, and harden by enforcing org-wide SSO, disallowing classic PATs, IP allowlisting for PAT use, enabling secret scanning with push protection, and alerting on burst git clone patterns from runners and unusual user agents.
