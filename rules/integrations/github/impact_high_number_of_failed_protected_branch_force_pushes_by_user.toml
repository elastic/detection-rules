### Investigating Several Failed Protected Branch Force Pushes by User

This rule flags a single user generating multiple failed force push attempts to protected branches within a short span, indicating attempts to rewrite commit history and bypass branch protections. An attacker with a compromised maintainer role repeatedly tries to roll back a security fix, delete prior commits, and erase history entries before pushing a malicious revision. This activity threatens code integrity, disrupts pipelines, and can propagate harmful changes across repositories.

### Possible investigation steps

- Pull audit entries for the rejected updates to confirm the rejection reasons and the exact org/repo/branch targets, then reconstruct the timeline and sequence of attempts.
- Verify the user's current and recent permissions, team membership, and role changes, and confirm whether any admin or ownership transfers occurred before the attempts.
- Correlate the attempts with authentication and token activity (SSO logins, PAT/SSH key usage, IP/device fingerprints, geo), flagging any new or unusual sources.
- Review branch protection settings and recent edits (require status checks, linear history, admin enforcement, force push exemptions) to detect policy tampering or misconfiguration.
- Identify the specific commits the force pushes sought to overwrite by diffing the attempted ref against the protected branch head, prioritizing impacts to security fixes, release branches, or signed commits.

### False positive analysis

- During a repository migration or history cleanup, a maintainer runs a local script that loops through branches and tries to push rewritten commits with --force, but newly tightened branch protection rejects each attempt, resulting in multiple failures.
- A developer who previously had a force-push exemption on a protected release branch loses that permission during a role or team change and continues their usual rebase-and-force-push workflow, causing several rapid rejected ref updates.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately block the user in the GitHub organization, revoke all active personal access tokens and SSH keys from their account, and force sign-out to stop further push attempts.
- On each affected repository and branch (e.g., main, release/*), remove any force-push exemptions, enable “Include administrators,” require signed commits and status checks, and restrict push access to specific teams.
- Purge staging artifacts by deleting any branches or tags the user created around the attempts, rotate the user’s password and regenerate PATs/SSH keys, and remove newly registered keys or OAuth apps added during the window.
- Validate recovery by confirming the protected branch HEAD matches the last known good signed commit SHA, re-running CI for impacted repos, and creating a restore point tag for rapid rollback.
- Escalate to incident response if any attempts targeted main or release branches, originated from a newly created PAT/SSH key or an unrecognized IP/device, or the user holds repo admin/organization owner rights.
- Harden long term by enforcing org-wide 2FA/SSO, removing all standing force-push exemptions, requiring CODEOWNERS approvals on protected branches, and enabling audit alerts for branch protection edits and new credential creation.
