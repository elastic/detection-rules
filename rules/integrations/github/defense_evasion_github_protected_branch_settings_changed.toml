This rule detects setting modifications for protected branches of a GitHub repository. Branch protection rules can be
used to enforce certain workflows or requirements before a contributor can push changes to a branch in your repository.
Changes to these protected branch settings should be investigated and verified as legitimate activity. Unauthorized
changes could be used to lower your organization's security posture and leave you exposed for future attacks.
