### Investigating User Added as Owner for Azure Application

Azure applications often require specific permissions for functionality, managed by assigning user roles. An adversary might exploit this by adding themselves or a compromised account as an owner, gaining elevated privileges to alter configurations or access sensitive data. The detection rule monitors audit logs for successful operations where a user is added as an application owner, flagging potential unauthorized privilege escalations.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the Azure audit logs to confirm the operation by filtering for event.dataset:azure.auditlogs and azure.auditlogs.operation_name:"Add owner to application" with a successful outcome.
- Identify the user account that was added as an owner and the account that performed the operation to determine if they are legitimate or potentially compromised.
- Check the history of activities associated with both the added owner and the account that performed the operation to identify any suspicious behavior or patterns.
- Verify the application's current configuration and permissions to assess any changes made after the new owner was added.
- Contact the legitimate owner or administrator of the Azure application to confirm whether the addition of the new owner was authorized.
- Investigate any recent changes in the organization's user access policies or roles that might explain the addition of a new owner.

### False positive analysis

- Routine administrative actions: Regular maintenance or updates by IT staff may involve adding users as application owners. To manage this, create a list of authorized personnel and exclude their actions from triggering alerts.
- Automated processes: Some applications may have automated scripts or services that add users as owners for operational purposes. Identify these processes and configure exceptions for their activities.
- Organizational changes: During mergers or restructuring, there may be legitimate reasons for adding multiple users as application owners. Temporarily adjust the rule to accommodate these changes and review the audit logs manually.
- Testing and development: In development environments, users may be added as owners for testing purposes. Exclude these environments from the rule or set up a separate monitoring policy with adjusted thresholds.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately revoke the added user's owner permissions from the Azure application to prevent further unauthorized access or configuration changes.
- Conduct a thorough review of recent activity logs for the affected application to identify any unauthorized changes or data access that may have occurred since the user was added as an owner.
- Reset credentials and enforce multi-factor authentication for the compromised or suspicious account to prevent further misuse.
- Notify the security team and relevant stakeholders about the incident for awareness and potential escalation if further investigation reveals broader compromise.
- Implement additional monitoring on the affected application and related accounts to detect any further unauthorized access attempts or privilege escalations.
- Review and update access control policies to ensure that only authorized personnel can modify application ownership, and consider implementing stricter approval processes for such changes.
- Document the incident, including actions taken and lessons learned, to improve response strategies and prevent recurrence.
