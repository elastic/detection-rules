### Investigating Microsoft Entra ID SharePoint Access for User Principal via Auth Broker

This rule identifies non-interactive sign-ins to SharePoint Online via the Microsoft Authentication Broker application using a refresh token or Primary Refresh Token (PRT). This type of activity may indicate token replay attacks, OAuth abuse, or automated access from previously consented apps or stolen sessions.

This is a [New Terms rule](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/rules-ui-create.html#create-new-terms-rule) that detects the first occurrence of a user principal name accessing SharePoint Online via the Microsoft Authentication Broker application in the last 14 days.

### Possible Investigation Steps:

- `azure.signinlogs.properties.user_principal_name`: Identify the user involved. Investigate whether this user typically accesses SharePoint or if this is an anomaly.
- `azure.signinlogs.properties.app_display_name`: Verify the application used (e.g., Authentication Broker). Determine if the app is expected for SharePoint access in your environment.
- `azure.signinlogs.properties.resource_display_name`: Review the resource being accessed. SharePoint activity should be aligned with job roles or historical usage.
- `azure.signinlogs.properties.incoming_token_type`: Indicates the token type used. Look for `refreshToken` or `primaryRefreshToken`, which may point to token replay or silent access.
- `azure.signinlogs.properties.is_interactive`: If false, indicates the sign-in was non-interactive. Correlate with recent sign-ins to understand if a prior session may have been reused.
- `user_agent.original`: Analyze the user agent string for automation indicators (e.g., scripts, unusual clients). Compare with what’s typical for the user or device.
- `source.ip`: Check the originating IP address. Investigate if the IP is associated with data centers, VPNs, anonymizers, or is geographically unusual for the user.
- `source.geo.*`: Evaluate sign-in location details. Determine if the sign-in location aligns with expected travel or usage behavior.
- `azure.signinlogs.properties.applied_conditional_access_policies`: Review whether Conditional Access policies were triggered or bypassed. Investigate if required controls (like MFA) were applied.
- `azure.signinlogs.properties.authentication_processing_details`: Review any details about the authentication, such as token type or scopes. This may indicate delegated access or automation patterns.

### False Positive Analysis

- Certain MDM or mobile app scenarios may use refresh tokens legitimately via brokered apps.
- Automated processes using authorized, scripted clients could trigger this activity, especially in developer or operations environments.
- If Conditional Access policies are configured in “report-only” mode or exempted for trusted apps, activity may appear unusual but be authorized.

### Response and Remediation

- If activity appears unauthorized:
  - Investigate and revoke active sessions or refresh tokens.
  - Notify the user and validate expected activity.
  - Review and audit app consent permissions and remove unused or high-risk delegated access.
- Harden Conditional Access policies to limit non-interactive access to sensitive resources.
- Monitor for repeated use of the same user agent, IP, or token type across other users to identify broader campaigns.
- Consider alerting on unusual patterns in sign-in frequency, geography, and application usage for SharePoint and other key services.
