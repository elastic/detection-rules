### Investigating Microsoft Entra ID Exccessive Account Lockouts Detected

This rule detects a high number of sign-in failures due to account lockouts (error code `50053`) in Microsoft Entra ID sign-in logs. These lockouts are typically caused by repeated authentication failures, often as a result of brute-force tactics such as password spraying, credential stuffing, or automated guessing. This detection is time-bucketed and aggregates attempts to identify bursts or coordinated campaigns targeting multiple users.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review `user_id_list` and `user_principal_name`: Check if targeted users include high-value accounts such as administrators, service principals, or shared inboxes.
- Check `error_codes` and `result_description`: Validate that `50053` (account locked) is the consistent failure type. Messages indicating "malicious IP" activity suggest Microsoftâ€™s backend flagged the source.
- Analyze `ip_list` and `source_orgs`: Identify whether the activity originated from known malicious infrastructure (e.g., VPNs, botnets, or public cloud providers). In the example, traffic originates from `MASSCOM`, which should be validated.
- Inspect `device_detail_browser` and `user_agent`: Clients like `"Python Requests"` indicate scripted automation rather than legitimate login attempts.
- Evaluate `unique_users` vs. `total_attempts`: A high ratio suggests distributed attacks across multiple accounts, characteristic of password spraying.
- Correlate `client_app_display_name` and `incoming_token_type`: PowerShell or unattended sign-in clients may be targeted for automation or legacy auth bypass.
- Review `conditional_access_status` and `risk_state`: If Conditional Access was not applied and risk was not flagged, policy scope or coverage should be reviewed.
- Validate time range (`first_seen`, `last_seen`): Determine whether the attack is a short burst or part of a longer campaign.

### False positive analysis

- Misconfigured clients, scripts, or services with outdated credentials may inadvertently cause lockouts.
- Repeated lockouts from known internal IPs or during credential rotation windows could be benign.
- Legacy applications without modern auth support may repeatedly fail and trigger Smart Lockout.
- Specific known user agents (e.g., corporate service accounts).
- Internal IPs or cloud-hosted automation with expected failure behavior.

### Response and remediation

- Investigate locked accounts immediately. Confirm if the account was successfully accessed prior to lockout.
- Reset credentials for impacted users and enforce MFA before re-enabling accounts.
- Block malicious IPs or ASN at the firewall, identity provider, or Conditional Access level.
- Audit authentication methods in use, and enforce modern auth (OAuth, SAML) over legacy protocols.
- Strengthen Conditional Access policies to reduce exposure from weak locations, apps, or clients.
- Conduct credential hygiene audits to assess reuse and rotation for targeted accounts.
