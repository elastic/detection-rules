## Investigation Guide: Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access Policy (CAP) Modified

Azure Conditional Access Policies (CAPs) are critical for enforcing secure access requirements such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), restricting specific users or groups, and managing sign-in conditions. Modifying these policies can be a technique for weakening an organization’s defenses and maintaining persistence after initial access.

This rule detects a successful update to a Conditional Access Policy in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).

### Possible Investigation Steps

- **Identify the user who modified the policy:**
  - Check the value of `azure.auditlogs.properties.initiated_by.user.userPrincipalName` to determine the identity that made the change.
  - Investigate their recent activity to determine if this change was expected or authorized.

- **Review the modified policy name:**
  - Look at `azure.auditlogs.properties.target_resources.*.display_name` to find the name of the affected policy.
  - Determine whether this policy is related to critical controls (e.g., requiring MFA for admins).

- **Analyze the policy change:**
  - Compare the `old_value` and `new_value` fields under `azure.auditlogs.properties.target_resources.*.modified_properties.*`.
  - Look for security-reducing changes, such as:
    - Removing users/groups from enforcement.
    - Disabling MFA or risk-based conditions.
    - Introducing exclusions that reduce the policy’s coverage.

- **Correlate with other activity:**
  - Pivot on `azure.auditlogs.properties.activity_datetime` to identify if any suspicious sign-ins occurred after the policy was modified.
  - Check for related authentication logs, particularly from the same IP address (`azure.auditlogs.properties.initiated_by.user.ipAddress`).

- **Assess the user's legitimacy:**
  - Review the initiator’s Azure role, group memberships, and whether their account was recently elevated or compromised.
  - Investigate whether this user has a history of modifying policies or if this is anomalous.

### Validation & False Positive Considerations

- **Authorized administrative changes:** Some organizations routinely update CAPs as part of policy tuning or role-based access reviews.
- **Security reviews or automation:** Scripts, CI/CD processes, or third-party compliance tools may programmatically update CAPs.
- **Employee lifecycle events:** Policy changes during employee onboarding/offboarding may include updates to access policies.

If any of these cases apply and align with the activity's context, consider tuning the rule or adding exceptions for expected patterns.

### Response & Remediation

- Revert unauthorized or insecure changes to the Conditional Access Policy immediately.
- Temporarily increase monitoring of CAP modifications and sign-in attempts.
- Lock or reset the credentials of the user account that made the change if compromise is suspected.
- Conduct a broader access review of conditional access policies and privileged user activity.
- Implement stricter change management and alerting around CAP changes.
