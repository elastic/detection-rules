### Investigating Microsoft Entra ID Session Reuse with Suspicious Graph Access

This rule identifies when Microsoft Graph is accessed from a different IP than the one used for the original sign-in,
but using the same session ID within 5 minutes. This may suggest an adversary has stolen a session cookie or refresh/access
token and is impersonating the user from an alternate host or location.

This rule uses ES|QL aggregations and thus has dynamically generated fields. Correlation of the values in the alert document may need to be
performed to the original sign-in and Graph events for further context.

### Investigation Steps

- Review the `user_id`, `session_id`, and `source_ip_list`. Confirm whether both IPs belong to the same user and geography.
- Check for inconsistencies in `client_id_list` (e.g., unknown apps) or user agents across correlated events.
- Investigate recent phishing reports or device infections for the `user_id`.
- Pivot to Entra ID `auditlogs` to see if a device was registered or privileges were modified.
- Review `graph_time` to determine what action was taken after the sign-in.
- Use the `session_id` to correlate with other logs in the same time window to identify any additional suspicious activity.

### False Positive Analysis
- This pattern may occur if the user is switching between networks (e.g., corporate to mobile) or using a VPN.
- Developers or power users leveraging multiple environments may also trigger this detection if session persistence spans IP ranges.
- However, this behavior is rare and warrants investigation when rapid IP switching and Graph access are involved.
- If the user is a developer or automation engineer, validate if this behavior was for testing purposes.
- If the user is a system administrator, validate if this behavior was for administrative purposes.

### Response Recommendations

- If confirmed malicious, revoke all refresh/access tokens for the `user_id`.
- Block the source IP(s) involved in the Graph access.
- Notify the user and reset credentials.
- Review session control policies and conditional access enforcement.
- Monitor for follow-on activity, such as lateral movement or privilege escalation.
- Review conditional access policies to ensure they are enforced correctly.
