This rule detects when a forbidden request is made from an unusual user agent in a Kubernetes environment.
Adversary tooling may use non-standard or unexpected user agents to interact with the Kubernetes API, which
can indicate an attempt to evade detection or blend in with legitimate traffic. In combination with a forbidden
request, this behavior can suggest an adversary is attempting to exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations
in the Kubernetes cluster.
