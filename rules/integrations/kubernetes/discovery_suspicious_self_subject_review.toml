description = """
This rule detects when a service account or node attempts to enumerate their own permissions via the
selfsubjectaccessreview or selfsubjectrulesreview APIs. This is highly unusual behavior for non-human identities like
service accounts and nodes. An adversary may have gained access to credentials/tokens and this could be an attempt to
determine what privileges they have to facilitate further movement or execution within the cluster.
"""

    An administrator may submit this request as an "impersonatedUser" to determine what privileges a particular service
    account has been granted. However, an adversary may utilize the same technique as a means to determine the
    privileges of another token other than that of the compromised account.
