This rule detects when a service account makes an unauthorized request for resources from the API server. Service
accounts follow a very predictable pattern of behavior. A service account should never send an unauthorized request to
the API server. This behavior is likely an indicator of compromise or of a problem within the cluster. An adversary may
have gained access to credentials/tokens and this could be an attempt to access or create resources to facilitate
further movement or execution within the cluster.
