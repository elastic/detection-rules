description = """
This rule detects an attempt to create or modify a pod using the host IPC namespace. This gives access to data used by
any pod that also use the hosts IPC namespace. If any process on the host or any processes in a pod uses the hosts
inter-process communication mechanisms (shared memory, semaphore arrays, message queues, etc.), an attacker can
read/write to those same mechanisms. They may look for files in /dev/shm or use ipcs to check for any IPC facilities
being used.

    An administrator or developer may want to use a pod that runs as root and shares the host's IPC, Network, and PID
    namespaces for debugging purposes. If something is going wrong in the cluster and there is no easy way to SSH onto
    the host nodes directly, a privileged pod of this nature can be useful for viewing things like iptable rules and
    network namespaces from the host's perspective. Add exceptions for trusted container images using the query field
