description = """
This rule detects when a user creates a pod/container running in privileged mode. A highly privileged container has
access to the node's resources and breaks the isolation between containers. If compromised, an attacker can use the
privileged container to gain access to the underlying host. Gaining access to the host may provide the adversary with
the opportunity to achieve follow-on objectives, such as establishing persistence, moving laterally within the
environment, or setting up a command and control channel on the host.
"""

    """
    By default a container is not allowed to access any devices on the host, but a "privileged" container is given
    access to all devices on the host. This allows the container nearly all the same access as processes running on the
    host. An administrator may want to run a privileged container to use operating system administrative capabilities
    such as manipulating the network stack or accessing hardware devices from within the cluster.
