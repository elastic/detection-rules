### Investigating Kubernetes Cluster-Admin Role Binding Created

This rule flags when someone creates a RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding that assigns the cluster-admin role, which grants unrestricted control over every Kubernetes resource and enables rapid privilege escalation or persistence. Attackers often abuse a stolen namespace service account to bind it to cluster-admin, then pivot to read secrets, change security controls, or deploy a privileged DaemonSet across all nodes to maintain control.

### Possible investigation steps

- Identify who created the binding by reviewing the audit event user identity, groups, source IP, and user agent, and confirm whether it matches an approved admin workflow or automation.  
- Inspect the created RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding to determine which subject received cluster-admin, whether it targets a service account or external identity, and whether the subject is expected to have cluster-wide privileges.  
- Correlate the creator and bound subject with recent authentication events and credential changes to spot compromised accounts, unusual access locations, or use of long-lived tokens.  
- Review subsequent Kubernetes audit activity from the same actor or newly privileged subject for rapid follow-on actions such as listing secrets, creating privileged pods/daemonsets, modifying RBAC, or disabling admission controls.  
- Validate the change against change management records and repository-based RBAC manifests, and if unauthorized, assess scope by enumerating other recent privileged RBAC grants created around the same time.

### False positive analysis

- A cluster bootstrap, upgrade, or recovery workflow legitimately creates or re-creates a ClusterRoleBinding/RoleBinding to `cluster-admin` for a break-glass admin user or core control-plane service account as part of restoring expected RBAC state.  
- An approved operational change temporarily grants `cluster-admin` to a namespace service account or automation identity to perform broad maintenance tasks (e.g., installing cluster-scoped resources), and the binding creation is captured during the allowed change window.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately identify and delete or edit the newly created RoleBinding/ClusterRoleBinding granting `cluster-admin`, then revoke the bound subject’s access by rotating the affected service account token or disabling the implicated user/identity provider account.  
- Quarantine likely-abused workloads by scaling down or deleting pods/deployments created by the newly privileged subject and blocking its network access with namespace isolation policies while you preserve relevant audit logs and YAML manifests.  
- Enumerate and undo follow-on changes made after the binding creation, including additional RBAC grants, new cluster-scoped resources (CRDs, webhooks), privileged DaemonSets, secret reads, or changes to admission controllers, and rotate any exposed credentials found in Secrets.  
- Recover by restoring RBAC and critical cluster resources from GitOps or known-good backups, then re-apply least-privilege roles and validate access with `kubectl auth can-i` for impacted identities and namespaces.  
- Escalate to incident response leadership immediately if the binding targets a service account, an external identity not in the admin group, or if there is evidence of secret access, privileged workload creation, or persistence mechanisms (e.g., new webhooks or DaemonSets).  
- Harden by enforcing RBAC via GitOps-only change control, restricting `cluster-admin` binding creation with admission policy (ValidatingAdmissionPolicy/Kyverno/OPA Gatekeeper), requiring MFA and short-lived tokens for admins, and alerting on any creation or modification of cluster-wide RBAC bindings.
