This rule detects unusual request responses in Kubernetes audit logs through the use of the
"new_terms" rule type. In production environments, default API requests are typically made by
system components or trusted users, who are expected to have a consistent user agent and
allowed response annotations. By monitoring for anomalies in the username and response
annotations, this rule helps identify potential unauthorized access or misconfigurations
in the Kubernetes environment.
