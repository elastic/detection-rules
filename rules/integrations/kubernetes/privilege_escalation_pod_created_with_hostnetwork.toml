This rules detects an attempt to create or modify a pod attached to the host network. HostNetwork allows a pod to use
the node network namespace. Doing so gives the pod access to any service running on localhost of the host. An attacker
could use this access to snoop on network activity of other pods on the same node or bypass restrictive network policies
applied to its given namespace.

    An administrator or developer may want to use a pod that runs as root and shares the hosts IPC, Network, and PID
    namespaces for debugging purposes. If something is going wrong in the cluster and there is no easy way to SSH onto
    the host nodes directly, a privileged pod of this nature can be useful for viewing things like iptable rules and
    network namespaces from the host's perspective. Add exceptions for trusted container images using the query field
