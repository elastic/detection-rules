description = """
This rule detects a request to attach a controller service account to an existing or new pod running in the kube-system
namespace. By default, controllers running as part of the API Server utilize admin-equivalent service accounts hosted in
the kube-system namespace. Controller service accounts aren't normally assigned to running pods and could indicate
adversary behavior within the cluster. An attacker that can create or modify pods or pod controllers in the kube-system
namespace, can assign one of these admin-equivalent service accounts to a pod and abuse their powerful token to escalate
privileges and gain complete cluster control.
