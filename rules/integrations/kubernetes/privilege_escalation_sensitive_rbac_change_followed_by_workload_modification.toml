### Investigating Kubernetes Sensitive RBAC Change Followed by Workload Modification

This rule detects when a user grants or broadens high-risk permissions in a Role/ClusterRole and then quickly creates or patches a DaemonSet, Deployment, or CronJob, a strong signal of RBAC-driven privilege escalation followed by payload deployment. Attackers often add wildcard access or escalation verbs to a new role, bind it to their identity, then patch a workload to run a malicious container across nodes or on a schedule to establish persistence.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the Role/ClusterRole change diff to identify newly granted wildcard resources/verbs or escalation permissions (e.g., bind, impersonate, escalate) and determine the effective access increase for the actor.
- Identify any RoleBinding/ClusterRoleBinding creations or updates around the same time to see whether the modified role was bound to the same principal or a newly created service account.
- Inspect the subsequent DaemonSet/Deployment/CronJob spec changes for malicious indicators such as new images, added initContainers, elevated securityContext (privileged/hostPID/hostNetwork), hostPath mounts, or suspicious command/args.
- Correlate pod runtime activity from the modified workload (image pulls, container starts, outbound connections, and access to secrets/configmaps) to confirm execution and scope of impact.
- Validate the actor’s legitimacy by checking whether the request originated from expected IP/user-agent and whether the identity is associated with approved CI/CD automation or an unusual interactive session.

### False positive analysis

- A platform engineer performing an urgent, legitimate RBAC adjustment (e.g., expanding a Role/ClusterRole for a new feature rollout) and then immediately patching or deploying a DaemonSet/Deployment/CronJob as part of the same change window can match this sequence.  
- A CI/CD pipeline or GitOps-style workflow using a non-system:masters identity may update RBAC manifests and then apply workload updates within minutes during routine releases, producing this pattern without malicious intent.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately revoke or roll back the risky Role/ClusterRole changes and remove any new/updated RoleBinding/ClusterRoleBinding that ties the elevated permissions to the triggering user or service account.  
- Quarantine the modified Deployment/DaemonSet/CronJob by scaling it to zero or deleting it and cordon/drain affected nodes if pods ran privileged, used hostPath mounts, or executed on many nodes.  
- Rotate credentials and access paths exposed through the workload (service account tokens, kubeconfig files, mounted secrets, cloud keys) and invalidate any newly issued tokens tied to the actor.  
- For eradication and recovery, redeploy workloads from trusted Git/registry sources, block the suspicious images/digests in admission controls, and verify no persistence remains via CronJobs, DaemonSets, webhook configurations, or additional RBAC bindings.  
- Escalate to incident response and platform leadership if the RBAC change included wildcard permissions or escalation verbs, if the workload ran privileged/hostNetwork/hostPID, or if sensitive secrets were accessed or exfiltration is suspected.  
- Harden by enforcing least-privilege RBAC, requiring peer approval for RBAC changes, restricting workload mutations via GitOps-only service accounts, and using admission policies to deny privileged pods, hostPath mounts, and unapproved registries.
