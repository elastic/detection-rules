This rule detects network events that may indicate the use of VNC traffic to the Internet. VNC is commonly used by
system administrators to remotely control a system for maintenance or to use shared resources. It should almost never be
directly exposed to the Internet, as it is frequently targeted and exploited by threat actors as an initial access or
backdoor vector.

    """
    VNC connections may be made directly to Linux cloud server instances but such connections are usually made only by
    engineers. VNC is less common than SSH or RDP but may be required by some work flows such as remote access and
    support for specialized software products or servers. Such work-flows are usually known and not unexpected. Usage
    that is unfamiliar to server or network owners can be unexpected and suspicious.
