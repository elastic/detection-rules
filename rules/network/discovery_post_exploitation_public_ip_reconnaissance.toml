Commonly, once an adversary has successfully placed an implant they perform a check of their public IP to validate that
they are able to get to the Internet as well as if they are on the right target. Among others, this has been observed in
campaigns leveraging the information stealer, Trickbot. This rule identifies domains commonly used by adversaries for
post-exploitation IP reconnaissance.
