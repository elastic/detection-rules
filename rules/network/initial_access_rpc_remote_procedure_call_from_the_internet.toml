This rule detects network events that may indicate the use of RPC traffic from the Internet. RPC is commonly used by
system administrators to remotely control a system for maintenance or to use shared resources. It should almost never be
directly exposed to the Internet, as it is frequently targeted and exploited by threat actors as an initial access or
back-door vector.
