description = """
This rule identifies a potential SYN-Based port scan. A SYN port scan is a technique employed by attackers to scan a
target network for open ports by sending SYN packets to multiple ports and observing the response. Attackers use this
method to identify potential entry points or services that may be vulnerable to exploitation, allowing them to launch
targeted attacks or gain unauthorized access to the system or network, compromising its security and potentially leading
to data breaches or further malicious activities. This rule proposes threshold logic to check for connection attempts
from one source host to 10 or more destination ports using 2 or less packets per port.
