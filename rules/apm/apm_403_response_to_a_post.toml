### Disclaimer

### Investigating Web Application Suspicious Activity: POST Request Declined

Web applications often use POST requests to handle data submissions securely. However, adversaries may exploit this by attempting unauthorized actions, triggering a 403 error when access is denied. The detection rule identifies such anomalies by flagging POST requests that receive a 403 response, indicating potential misuse or probing by attackers.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the specific POST request details, including the URL and parameters, to understand what action was attempted and why it might have been denied.
- Examine the source IP address of the POST request to determine if it is associated with known malicious activity or if it is an unusual source for your application.
- Check the user-agent string in the request headers to identify if the request was made by a legitimate browser or a suspicious tool or script.
- Analyze the frequency and pattern of 403 responses from the same IP or user-agent to identify potential probing or brute force attempts.
- Investigate the timing of the POST request in relation to other suspicious activities in the logs to identify any correlation with other alerts or incidents.
- Use Osquery to gather additional context from the server hosting the web application. For example, run the following query to check for recent changes in web server configuration files that might affect POST request handling:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM file WHERE path LIKE '/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf' OR path LIKE '/etc/nginx/nginx.conf' ORDER BY mtime DESC LIMIT 5;
  ```
- Review application logs for any error messages or warnings around the time of the POST request to identify potential misconfigurations or application errors.
- Check for any recent updates or changes to the web application code that might have inadvertently introduced stricter access controls or bugs.
- Investigate whether the POST request was part of a legitimate user's session by correlating it with authentication logs and session data.
- Consult threat intelligence sources to determine if there are any known vulnerabilities or attack patterns associated with the specific endpoint or application version targeted by the POST request.

### False positive analysis

- Legitimate users may trigger a 403 response when they attempt to access restricted areas of a web application without proper permissions, such as administrative sections or user-specific content.
- Automated scripts or bots used for web scraping or data collection might inadvertently cause 403 errors if they attempt to access protected resources, leading to false positives.
- Security tools or plugins that perform vulnerability scanning on web applications can generate POST requests that result in 403 responses, which are not necessarily malicious.
- Users can manage these false positives by creating exceptions for known IP addresses or user agents that frequently cause 403 errors but are verified as non-threatening.
- Implementing a whitelist for specific endpoints or user roles that are known to trigger 403 responses during normal operations can help reduce unnecessary alerts.
- Regularly reviewing and updating the list of exceptions based on the analysis of web application logs and user behavior patterns can help maintain the accuracy of the detection rule.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately review the logs to identify the source IP address of the suspicious POST requests and block it at the firewall or web application firewall (WAF) to prevent further unauthorized attempts.
- Analyze the request payloads to determine if there are any patterns or specific data being targeted, which could indicate the attacker's intent or the vulnerability being exploited.
- Conduct a thorough review of the web application's access control policies to ensure that permissions are correctly configured and that sensitive endpoints are adequately protected.
- Escalate the incident to the security operations center (SOC) or incident response team if the activity appears to be part of a larger attack campaign or if multiple systems are affected.
- Implement enhanced logging for POST requests, including capturing request headers and payloads, to improve visibility and aid in future investigations.
- Integrate threat intelligence feeds to correlate the detected activity with known attack patterns or threat actors, providing additional context for the investigation.
- Restore any affected systems or services to their operational state by rolling back unauthorized changes and applying necessary patches or updates to address any identified vulnerabilities.
- Conduct a post-incident review to identify gaps in the current security posture and update incident response plans accordingly.
- Implement security hardening measures such as input validation, rate limiting, and multi-factor authentication to reduce the risk of similar incidents in the future.
- Educate development and operations teams on secure coding practices and the importance of regular security assessments to prevent exploitation of web application vulnerabilities."""
