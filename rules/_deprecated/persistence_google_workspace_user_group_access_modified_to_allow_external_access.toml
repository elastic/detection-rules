User groups in Google Workspace are created to help manage users permissions and access to various resources and
applications. The security label is only applied to a group when users within that group are expected to access
sensitive data and/or resources so administrators add this label to easily manage security groups better. Adversaries
with administrator access may modify a security group to allow external access from members outside the organization.
This detection does not capture all modifications to security groups, but only those that could increase the risk
associated with them.

### Important Information Regarding Google Workspace Event Lag Times
- As per Google's documentation, Google Workspace administrators may observe lag times ranging from minutes up to 3 days between the time of an event's occurrence and the event being visible in the Google Workspace admin/audit logs.
- This rule is configured to run every 10 minutes with a lookback time of 130 minutes.
- To reduce the risk of false negatives, consider reducing the interval that the Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) Filebeat module polls Google's reporting API for new events.
- By default, `var.interval` is set to 2 hours (2h). Consider changing this interval to a lower value, such as 10 minutes (10m).
- See the following references for further information:
  - https://support.google.com/a/answer/7061566
  - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-module-google_workspace.html"""
