### Investigating BPF Program or Map Load via bpftool

This rule flags bpftool executions that load, attach, run, or pin eBPF programs and that create or pin maps/links, actions that can change kernel behavior without traditional user-space artifacts. Adversaries can use bpftool to load a malicious eBPF object, attach it to a tracepoint or traffic control hook, and pin the program and maps in bpffs so it persists and hides or filters activity across reboots.

### Possible investigation steps

- Capture full command line, parent process, user context, TTY/session, and current working directory to determine whether execution was interactive administration or automated tooling.  
- Enumerate loaded and pinned eBPF artifacts and their attachment points using `bpftool prog show`, `bpftool map show`, `bpftool link show`, and a filesystem review of `/sys/fs/bpf` to identify unexpected persistence.  
- Identify the eBPF object/source used for the load (path, inode, hash, package origin) and retrieve a copy for analysis, including checking for recent writes or downloads in the same directory tree.  
- Correlate the event time with system logs and other telemetry for follow-on activity such as privilege escalation, module loads, network filtering changes, or suspicious process hiding indicators.  
- Hunt for persistence mechanisms that would reload the same eBPF program after reboot (systemd units/timers, cron, init scripts, container entrypoints) and validate against known legitimate observability/network stacks in the environment.

### False positive analysis

- A system administrator or SRE may run `bpftool prog load/attach/pin` or `bpftool map create/pin` during planned troubleshooting or performance investigation to temporarily instrument kernel events and persist objects under `/sys/fs/bpf` for multi-step validation.  
- A legitimate system service or boot-time automation may invoke `bpftool` to load and pin eBPF programs/maps as part of expected networking, security policy enforcement, or observability initialization, especially after upgrades or configuration changes that trigger reloading.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately isolate the host or container from the network and stop the initiating service/session, then detach any active hooks by removing pinned artifacts under `/sys/fs/bpf` and verifying with `bpftool prog show` and `bpftool link show` that the suspicious program/link is no longer attached.  
- Preserve evidence by collecting the full `bpftool` command line and parent chain, a recursive copy of `/sys/fs/bpf`, and the exact eBPF object file used for the load (path, hash, permissions, timestamps) before deleting or modifying artifacts.  
- Eradicate persistence by removing malicious eBPF pins, deleting or quarantining the associated `.o`/loader binaries, and disabling the boot-time mechanism that reloads them (systemd unit/timer, cron, init scripts, container entrypoint) followed by a controlled reboot to clear any remaining in-kernel state.  
- Recover by restoring the system to a known-good configuration, validating expected networking/observability behavior, and monitoring that no new pinned programs/maps/links reappear under `/sys/fs/bpf` after reboot or service restarts.  
- Escalate to incident response and kernel/rootkit specialists if the program attaches to security-relevant hooks (e.g., tracepoints/kprobes/LSM/tc) or if pinned objects reappear after removal, indicating an active persistence mechanism or compromised privileged runtime.  
- Harden by restricting `bpftool` availability and access to bpffs, enforcing least-privilege for CAP_BPF/CAP_SYS_ADMIN, requiring signed/managed eBPF loaders, and enabling controls that limit eBPF usage to approved components in production images and hosts."""
