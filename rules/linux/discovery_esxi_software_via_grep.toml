This rule requires data coming in from Elastic Defend.

### Elastic Defend Integration Setup
Elastic Defend is integrated into the Elastic Agent using Fleet. Upon configuration, the integration allows the Elastic Agent to monitor events on your host and send data to the Elastic Security app.

#### Prerequisite Requirements:
- Fleet is required for Elastic Defend.
- To configure Fleet Server refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-server.html).

#### The following steps should be executed in order to add the Elastic Defend integration on a Linux System:
- Go to the Kibana home page and click "Add integrations".
- In the query bar, search for "Elastic Defend" and select the integration to see more details about it.
- Click "Add Elastic Defend".
- Configure the integration name and optionally add a description.
- Select the type of environment you want to protect, either "Traditional Endpoints" or "Cloud Workloads".
- Select a configuration preset. Each preset comes with different default settings for Elastic Agent, you can further customize these later by configuring the Elastic Defend integration policy. [Helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/configure-endpoint-integration-policy.html).
- We suggest selecting "Complete EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)" as a configuration setting, that provides "All events; all preventions"
- Enter a name for the agent policy in "New agent policy name". If other agent policies already exist, you can click the "Existing hosts" tab and select an existing policy instead.
For more details on Elastic Agent configuration settings, refer to the [helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/8.10/agent-policy.html).
- Click "Save and Continue".
- To complete the integration, select "Add Elastic Agent to your hosts" and continue to the next section to install the Elastic Agent on your hosts.
For more details on Elastic Defend refer to the [helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/install-endpoint.html).

### Investigating ESXI Discovery via Grep

In virtualized environments, ESXi hosts manage VM files with specific extensions. Adversaries may exploit tools like grep to locate these files, aiming to gather intelligence or manipulate VMs. The detection rule identifies suspicious grep usage targeting VM file extensions, excluding legitimate processes, to flag potential threats. This helps in early detection of unauthorized VM file access attempts.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the alert details to confirm the process name is one of "grep", "egrep", or "pgrep" and verify the presence of VM-related file extensions in the process arguments.
- Check the process's parent executable to ensure it is not "/usr/share/qemu/init/qemu-kvm-init", which is excluded from the rule, to rule out false positives.
- Investigate the user account associated with the process to determine if it is a known and authorized user for accessing VM files.
- Examine the command line history for the user to identify any other suspicious commands executed around the same time as the alert.
- Use Osquery to gather additional context about the process. For example, run the following query to list all processes with VM-related arguments: `SELECT pid, name, path, cmdline FROM processes WHERE cmdline LIKE '%vmdk%' OR cmdline LIKE '%vmx%' OR cmdline LIKE '%vmxf%' OR cmdline LIKE '%vmsd%' OR cmdline LIKE '%vmsn%' OR cmdline LIKE '%vswp%' OR cmdline LIKE '%vmss%' OR cmdline LIKE '%nvram%' OR cmdline LIKE '%vmem%';`
- Analyze network activity from the host to identify any unusual connections or data transfers that may indicate exfiltration or further reconnaissance.
- Review system logs for any other anomalies or related events that occurred before or after the alert to build a timeline of activities.
- Check for any recent changes to VM files on the system, such as modifications or deletions, that could indicate tampering.
- Investigate any other alerts or incidents involving the same host or user to determine if this is part of a broader attack pattern.
- Consult with the system owner or administrator to verify if the activity was authorized or part of a legitimate maintenance task.

### False positive analysis

- System administrators or automated scripts may use grep to search for VM-related files as part of routine maintenance or monitoring tasks. These legitimate activities can trigger the detection rule, leading to false positives.
- Backup or snapshot management processes might involve searching for VM file extensions to ensure data integrity or to verify backup completion, which can also be mistakenly flagged.
- Developers or IT personnel conducting audits or inventory checks on virtual environments may use grep to locate VM files, resulting in non-malicious alerts.
- To manage these false positives, users can create exceptions for known legitimate processes by excluding specific parent processes or scripts that regularly perform these actions.
- Implementing a whitelist of trusted users or service accounts that frequently interact with VM files can help reduce unnecessary alerts.
- Regularly review and update the exclusion list to accommodate changes in legitimate operational procedures, ensuring that only genuine threats are flagged.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to confirm the presence of unauthorized grep usage by reviewing process execution logs and correlating with other security events.
- If unauthorized access is confirmed, identify and terminate any malicious processes running on the system.
- Escalate the incident to the security operations center (SOC) or incident response team for further analysis and response.
- Review and enhance logging policies to ensure comprehensive monitoring of process execution and file access activities, focusing on VM-related files.
- Implement additional security controls, such as file integrity monitoring and access controls, to protect VM files from unauthorized access.
- Restore the system to its operational state by applying the latest security patches and updates, and verifying the integrity of VM files.
- Conduct a post-incident review to identify gaps in security controls and update incident response plans accordingly.
- Educate system administrators and users on recognizing and reporting suspicious activities related to VM file access.
- Consider integrating threat intelligence feeds and security information and event management (SIEM) solutions to enhance detection and response capabilities for similar threats in the future."""
