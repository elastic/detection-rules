This rule identifies an egress internet connection initiated by an SSH Daemon child process. This behavior is
indicative of the alteration of a shell configuration file or other mechanism that launches a process when a
new SSH login occurs. Attackers can also backdoor the SSH daemon to allow for persistence, call out to a C2
or to steal credentials.
