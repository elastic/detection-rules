### Investigating Linux Video Recording or Screenshot Activity Detected

This alert flags the launch of common Linux screenshot or screen-recording tools—such as scrot, gnome-screenshot, flameshot, grim, or obs—when triggered by an atypical parent process, indicating potential visual data collection. A typical attacker pattern is a compromised user session or remote shell spawning scrot or grim during credential entry to capture MFA codes and application windows, or starting simplescreenrecorder/obs to persistently record the desktop for later exfiltration.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the process lineage and session context to determine if the capture was launched interactively from a desktop or via ssh/cron/systemd or a script in transient directories.
- Inspect command-line options and environment variables (DISPLAY, WAYLAND_DISPLAY, XAUTHORITY) to identify window/region capture, explicit save targets, or headless clipboard-only usage.
- Search for newly created media files around the alert time (screenshots under ~/Pictures or /tmp, and recordings like .mkv/.webm) and evaluate their sensitivity and relevance.
- Verify binary provenance and integrity by checking installation logs, file path and ownership, hashes, and unexpected copies or modified ELF binaries in user-writable locations.
- Correlate with user and network telemetry for concurrent credential entry, browser MFA prompts, or outbound transfers/clipboard synchronization indicative of exfiltration.

### False positive analysis

- A user presses Print Screen or uses a desktop hotkey, and the environment launches gnome-screenshot, flameshot, or grim via a keybinding/compositor component, producing an uncommon parent despite benign activity.
- Legitimate demo or documentation recording with obs or simplescreenrecorder started by a wrapper script, cron, or a systemd unit can surface as a non-interactive start from an unusual parent without malicious intent.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately terminate the capture process (e.g., scrot, grim, flameshot, gnome-screenshot, simplescreenrecorder, obs) and isolate the host or terminate the GUI session, suspending the user and revoking SSH keys if the parent was sshd, cron, or a systemd unit.
- Eradicate launch points by deleting rogue systemd services/timers, crontab entries, ~/.config/autostart/*.desktop files, and scripts in /tmp or ~/bin that invoke these tools, and replace any trojanized binaries found outside package-managed paths.
- Recover by rotating passwords and invalidating MFA sessions/tokens used during the recorded period, then remove captured media (.png/.jpg/.webm/.mkv) from ~/Pictures, /tmp, and similar staging paths after evidence collection.
- Escalate to incident response and privacy/legal if screenshots/recordings contain credentials, customer data, or secrets, if execution originated from privileged users or servers, or if exfiltration is observed via scp/rsync/curl to external hosts.
- Harden endpoints by uninstalling unneeded screenshot/recording packages, enforcing allowlists and AppArmor/SELinux profiles that block scrot/grim/obs except for approved users, and requiring xdg-desktop-portal/PipeWire screencast prompts for console users only.
- Improve detection by alerting on these binaries executed by sshd/cron/systemd, repeated saves under ~/Pictures or /tmp, copies in user-writable paths (~/bin, /tmp), and outbound transfers of resulting media files.
