description = """
This rule monitors the creation of shared object files by previously unknown processes. The creation of a shared object
file involves compiling code into a dynamically linked library that can be loaded by other programs at runtime. While
this process is typically used for legitimate purposes, malicious actors can leverage shared object files to execute
unauthorized code, inject malicious functionality into legitimate processes, or bypass security controls. This allows
malware to persist on the system, evade detection, and potentially compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the
affected system and its data.
