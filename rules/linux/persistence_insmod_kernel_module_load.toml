### Investigating Kernel Module Load via Built-in Utility
I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with that request.

### Possible investigation steps

- Confirm the module actually loaded by reviewing `lsmod` or `/proc/modules` and correlate the module name to the alert timestamp in `dmesg` or `journalctl -k`.  
- Identify the exact `.ko` path and collect `modinfo` output plus file hash and signer state, then compare to known-good modules and verify package ownership via the system package manager where applicable.  
- Trace the launching chain to the initiating user session or automation by pivoting from the loader to its parent and surrounding process activity, and validate whether the actor had interactive root access or used privilege escalation.  
- Look for persistence or repeat load attempts by searching for related entries in `/etc/modules*`, `/etc/modprobe.d/`, systemd units, cron, and init scripts that reference the same module name or path.  
- Assess impact and stealth behavior by checking for kernel taint flags, newly created device nodes, hidden files or processes indicators, and any coincident network connections or security tool tampering after the load event.

### False positive analysis

- A system administrator or maintenance script may legitimately run `modprobe`/`insmod` to load required kernel modules (e.g., filesystem, networking, or hardware driver modules) during troubleshooting, new hardware enablement, or post-update validation.
- Routine system operations can trigger module loads via `modprobe` during boot, service startup, or configuration changes (e.g., enabling firewall/NAT, bridging, or overlay filesystem features), especially on hosts that dynamically load modules on demand.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately isolate the affected Linux host from the network (or restrict to management VLAN) and preserve volatile evidence by capturing `lsmod`, `/proc/modules`, `dmesg`/`journalctl -k`, and the exact `insmod`/`modprobe` command line and `.ko` path from process logs.  
- Contain further abuse by disabling interactive root access (lock/rotate privileged accounts and keys), stopping the initiating session or automation, and temporarily preventing additional module loads by setting `kernel.modules_disabled=1` where operationally safe.  
- Eradicate the persistence source by removing the suspicious `.ko` and any references to it in `/etc/modules*`, `/etc/modprobe.d/`, systemd unit files, init scripts, or cron, and reinstall/restore any affected kernel or driver packages from trusted repositories.  
- Recover with a controlled reboot into a known-good kernel, verify the module is no longer present via `lsmod` and that kernel logs show no repeat load attempts, then run integrity checks and rotate secrets that were accessible while the module was loaded.  
- Escalate to incident response for full forensics and potential reimage if the loaded module is unsigned/unknown, originates from a non-standard path (e.g., `/tmp`, user home, or `/dev/shm`), the kernel shows taint/rootkit-like behavior, or module-load attempts recur after cleanup.  
- Harden by enforcing kernel module signature verification (or lockdown mode), restricting access to `insmod`/`kmod`/`modprobe`, enabling mandatory access controls (SELinux/AppArmor), and adding continuous monitoring/alerting for module-load events and changes under `/lib/modules/` and module autoload configuration files."""

This rule requires data coming in from Elastic Defend.

### Elastic Defend Integration Setup
Elastic Defend is integrated into the Elastic Agent using Fleet. Upon configuration, the integration allows the Elastic Agent to monitor events on your host and send data to the Elastic Security app.

#### Prerequisite Requirements:
- Fleet is required for Elastic Defend.
- To configure Fleet Server refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-server.html).

#### The following steps should be executed in order to add the Elastic Defend integration on a Linux System:
- Go to the Kibana home page and click "Add integrations".
- In the query bar, search for "Elastic Defend" and select the integration to see more details about it.
- Click "Add Elastic Defend".
- Configure the integration name and optionally add a description.
- Select the type of environment you want to protect, either "Traditional Endpoints" or "Cloud Workloads".
- Select a configuration preset. Each preset comes with different default settings for Elastic Agent, you can further customize these later by configuring the Elastic Defend integration policy. [Helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/configure-endpoint-integration-policy.html).
- We suggest selecting "Complete EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)" as a configuration setting, that provides "All events; all preventions"
- Enter a name for the agent policy in "New agent policy name". If other agent policies already exist, you can click the "Existing hosts" tab and select an existing policy instead.
For more details on Elastic Agent configuration settings, refer to the [helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/8.10/agent-policy.html).
- Click "Save and Continue".
- To complete the integration, select "Add Elastic Agent to your hosts" and continue to the next section to install the Elastic Agent on your hosts.
For more details on Elastic Defend refer to the [helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/install-endpoint.html).
