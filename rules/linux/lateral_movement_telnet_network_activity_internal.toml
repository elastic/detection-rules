    Telnet can be used for both benign or malicious purposes. Telnet is included by default in some Linux distributions,
    so its presence is not inherently suspicious. The use of Telnet to manage devices remotely has declined in recent
    years in favor of more secure protocols such as SSH. Telnet usage by non-automated tools or frameworks may be
    suspicious.
