This rule requires data coming in from one of the following integrations:
- Elastic Defend
- Auditbeat

### Elastic Defend Integration Setup
Elastic Defend is integrated into the Elastic Agent using Fleet. Upon configuration, the integration allows the Elastic Agent to monitor events on your host and send data to the Elastic Security app.

#### Prerequisite Requirements:
- Fleet is required for Elastic Defend.
- To configure Fleet Server refer to the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-server.html).

#### The following steps should be executed in order to add the Elastic Defend integration on a Linux System:
- Go to the Kibana home page and click "Add integrations".
- In the query bar, search for "Elastic Defend" and select the integration to see more details about it.
- Click "Add Elastic Defend".
- Configure the integration name and optionally add a description.
- Select the type of environment you want to protect, either "Traditional Endpoints" or "Cloud Workloads".
- Select a configuration preset. Each preset comes with different default settings for Elastic Agent, you can further customize these later by configuring the Elastic Defend integration policy. [Helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/configure-endpoint-integration-policy.html).
- We suggest selecting "Complete EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)" as a configuration setting, that provides "All events; all preventions"
- Enter a name for the agent policy in "New agent policy name". If other agent policies already exist, you can click the "Existing hosts" tab and select an existing policy instead.
For more details on Elastic Agent configuration settings, refer to the [helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/8.10/agent-policy.html).
- Click "Save and Continue".
- To complete the integration, select "Add Elastic Agent to your hosts" and continue to the next section to install the Elastic Agent on your hosts.
For more details on Elastic Defend refer to the [helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/install-endpoint.html).

### Auditbeat Setup
Auditbeat is a lightweight shipper that you can install on your servers to audit the activities of users and processes on your systems. For example, you can use Auditbeat to collect and centralize audit events from the Linux Audit Framework. You can also use Auditbeat to detect changes to critical files, like binaries and configuration files, and identify potential security policy violations.

#### The following steps should be executed in order to add the Auditbeat on a Linux System:
- Elastic provides repositories available for APT and YUM-based distributions. Note that we provide binary packages, but no source packages.
- To install the APT and YUM repositories follow the setup instructions in this [helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/auditbeat/current/setup-repositories.html).
- To run Auditbeat on Docker follow the setup instructions in the [helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/auditbeat/current/running-on-docker.html).
- To run Auditbeat on Kubernetes follow the setup instructions in the [helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/auditbeat/current/running-on-kubernetes.html).
- For complete “Setup and Run Auditbeat” information refer to the [helper guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/auditbeat/current/setting-up-and-running.html).

### Investigating Connection to External Network via Telnet

Telnet is a protocol offering command-line access to remote systems, often used for network device management. Adversaries exploit Telnet to gain unauthorized access to external networks, bypassing security controls. The detection rule identifies Telnet connections to non-private IPs, flagging potential lateral movement or remote service abuse, aligning with MITRE ATT&CK's T1021 technique.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the alert details to identify the specific process.entity_id and destination.ip involved in the Telnet connection to a non-private IP address.
- Verify the legitimacy of the destination IP by checking if it belongs to known external services or if it is associated with any suspicious or malicious activity.
- Use Osquery to gather additional context about the process by running a query such as: `SELECT * FROM processes WHERE pid = <process_id>;` to retrieve details about the Telnet process, including its parent process and command-line arguments.
- Investigate the user account associated with the Telnet process by checking the process's user ID and correlating it with recent login activities to determine if the account has been compromised.
- Examine network logs to identify any other unusual or unauthorized connections originating from the same host, focusing on connections to external IPs.
- Check for any recent changes or anomalies in the system's configuration files or network settings that could indicate tampering or unauthorized access.
- Analyze historical data to determine if there have been previous Telnet connections from the same host to external networks, which could indicate a pattern of suspicious behavior.
- Correlate the Telnet activity with other security alerts or logs to identify potential lateral movement or coordinated attacks within the network.
- Investigate the host's security posture by reviewing installed software, open ports, and running services to identify any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that could have been exploited.
- Consult threat intelligence sources to determine if the destination IP or any related indicators of compromise are associated with known threat actors or campaigns.

### False positive analysis

- Telnet connections to external IPs that are part of legitimate business operations, such as remote management of company-owned devices, can trigger false positives. Users can handle these by creating exceptions for known IP addresses that are part of regular business activities.
- Automated scripts or monitoring tools that use Telnet for legitimate network management tasks may be flagged. To manage this, users can whitelist specific process names or scripts that are verified as non-threatening.
- Connections to cloud service providers or third-party vendors that use public IP addresses for legitimate services might be incorrectly flagged. Users should identify and exclude these IP ranges from the detection rule to prevent unnecessary alerts.
- Testing environments or labs that simulate external connections for development purposes can cause false positives. Users can exclude these environments by specifying their IP ranges or hostnames in the rule exceptions.
- Legacy systems that rely on Telnet for communication with external partners may be mistakenly identified as threats. Users should document and exclude these systems from the rule to ensure they are not flagged during routine operations.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the scope of the breach, including identifying any other systems that may have been accessed using Telnet.
- Review system logs and Telnet session records to gather evidence and understand the adversary's actions and objectives.
- Change all credentials that may have been exposed or used during the unauthorized Telnet sessions.
- Remove any unauthorized accounts or backdoors that may have been created by the adversary.
- Apply security patches and updates to the affected system to address any vulnerabilities that may have been exploited.
- Implement network segmentation to limit the ability of adversaries to move laterally within the network.
- Enhance logging and monitoring policies to include detailed Telnet session logs and alerts for connections to non-private IPs.
- Integrate threat intelligence feeds and security information and event management (SIEM) systems to improve detection and response capabilities.
- Conduct a post-incident review to identify gaps in security controls and update incident response plans accordingly."""
