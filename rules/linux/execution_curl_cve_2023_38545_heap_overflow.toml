Detects potential exploitation of curl CVE-2023-38545 by monitoring for vulnerable command line arguments in conjunction 
with an unusual command line length. A flaw in curl version <= 8.3 makes curl vulnerable to a heap based buffer overflow
during the SOCKS5 proxy handshake. Upgrade to curl version >= 8.4 to patch this vulnerability. This exploit can be executed 
with and without the use of environment variables. For increased visibility, enable the collection of http_proxy, 
HTTPS_PROXY and ALL_PROXY environment variables based on the instructions provided in the setup guide of this rule.

Elastic Defend integration does not collect environment variable logging by default.
In order to capture this behavior, this rule requires a specific configuration option set within the advanced settings of the Elastic Defend integration.
To set up environment variable capture for an Elastic Agent policy:
- Go to Security → Manage → Policies.
- Select an Elastic Agent policy.
- Click Show advanced settings.
- Scroll down or search for linux.advanced.capture_env_vars.
- Enter the names of env vars you want to capture, separated by commas.
- For this rule the linux.advanced.capture_env_vars variable should be set to "http_proxy,HTTPS_PROXY,ALL_PROXY".
- Click Save.
After saving the integration change, the Elastic Agents running this policy will be updated and the rule will function properly.
For more information on capturing environment variables refer to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/environment-variable-capture.html
