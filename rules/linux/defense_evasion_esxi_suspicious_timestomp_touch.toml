Identifies instances where the 'touch' command is executed on a Linux system with the "-r" flag,
which is used to modify the timestamp of a file based on another file's timestamp. The rule targets specific VM-related
paths, such as "/etc/vmware/", "/usr/lib/vmware/", or "/vmfs/*". These paths are associated with VMware virtualization
software, and their presence in the touch command arguments may indicate that a threat actor is attempting to
tamper with timestamps of VM-related files and configurations on the system.
