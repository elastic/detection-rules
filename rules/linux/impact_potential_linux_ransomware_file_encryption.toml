Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files or systems and demands payment 
(usually in cryptocurrency) in exchange for the decryption key. One important indicator of a 
ransomware attack is the mass encryption of the file system, after which a new file extension 
is added to the file. This rule identifies a sequence of 50 file extension rename events 
by the same process in a timespan of 1 second.
