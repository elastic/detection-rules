This rule identifies a sequence of 100 file extension rename events within a set of common file paths by the same 
process in a timespan of 1 second. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files or systems and 
demands payment (usually in cryptocurrency) in exchange for the decryption key. One important indicator of a ransomware
attack is the mass encryption of the file system, after which a new file extension is added to the file.
