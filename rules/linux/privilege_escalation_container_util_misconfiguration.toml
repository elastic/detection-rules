description = """
This rule monitors for the execution of processes that interact with Linux containers through an interactive shell 
without root permissions. Utilities such as runc and ctr are universal command-line utilities leveraged to interact 
with containers via root permissions. On systems where the access to these utilities are misconfigured, attackers might 
be able to create and run a container that mounts the root folder or spawn a privileged container vulnerable to a 
container escape attack, which might allow them to escalate privileges and gain further access onto the host file system.
