This detection rule detects the creation of a shell through a chain consisting of the execution of a suspicious binary
(located in a commonly abused location or executed manually) followed by a network event and ending with a shell being
spawned. Stageless reverse tcp shells display this behaviour. Attackers may spawn reverse shells to establish 
persistence onto a target system.
