### Investigating Connection Attempt by Non-SSH Root Session
Detection alerts from this rule indicate a strange or abnormal outbound connection attempt by a privileged process.  Here are some possible avenues of investigation:
- Examine unusual and active sessions using commands such as 'last -a', 'netstat -a', and 'w -a'.
- Analyze processes and command line arguments to detect anomalous process execution that may be acting as a listener.
- Analyze anomalies in the use of files that do not normally initiate connections.
- Examine processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication.
