### Investigating Linux Audio Recording Activity Detected

This rule flags executions of Linux audio-recording tools (arecord, parec, pw-record, ecasound, pw-cat -r, ffmpeg) started by uncommon parent processes, signaling potential covert microphone capture. Attackers often drop a systemd service or cron job that silently invokes arecord or ffmpeg to record from default PulseAudio/PipeWire devices and stash WAV/MP3 files under user directories or stream them to a remote host. Capturing ambient audio can reveal passwords, meeting content, and sensitive conversations, aiding reconnaissance and espionage.

### Possible investigation steps

- Examine the full process tree and session context (parent/grandparent, controlling TTY, logged-in user) to determine whether launch came from an expected desktop workflow versus non-interactive origins like cron, systemd, or ssh.
- Parse the command line to identify input device and output target, then hunt for created artifacts (WAV/MP3/OGG) under common stash paths (~/.cache, ~/.local/share, /tmp, /var/tmp, hidden directories) and verify timestamps and owner.
- If the command indicates streaming or piping, inspect recent outbound network connections and DNS from the process/user for RTMP/HTTP/SFTP endpoints and correlate with firewall or EDR flow logs to detect exfiltration.
- Check for persistence mechanisms that could re-invoke the recorder, including systemd user/system units and timers, cron/anacron entries, and shell scripts in autostart paths, and disable or quarantine any suspicious items.
- Review audio subsystem and device access evidence (audit logs for open/read on /dev/snd/* and PipeWire/PulseAudio logs showing record nodes) to confirm capture and identify the device and scope.

### False positive analysis

- ffmpeg is executed with -i to read an existing media file for transcode or audio extraction, not to capture from a microphone, which satisfies the rule conditions but is routine multimedia processing.
- A legitimate systemd or cron job starts arecord/parec/pw-record/pw-cat -r to periodically sample audio for device diagnostics or content creation, resulting in an uncommon parent process yet expected outputs under user or application directories.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately terminate arecord, parec, pw-record, ecasound, pw-cat -r, or ffmpeg processes launched by cron/systemd/ssh and stop any associated systemd units/timers, then block outbound RTMP/HTTP/SFTP connections from the recording user.
- Disable and remove persistence that invokes recording, including systemd .service/.timer files under /etc/systemd/system or ~/.config/systemd/user, cron entries in /etc/cron.* or user crontabs, and autostart scripts in ~/.config/autostart or /etc/xdg/autostart, and quarantine any unknown executables or wrappers in /tmp, /var/tmp, or hidden user directories that spawn these tools.
- Before cleanup, preserve the full command line and copies of recorded artifacts (WAV/MP3/OGG) located in ~/.cache, ~/.local/share, /tmp, /var/tmp, and hidden directories, then remove remaining audio files and staging folders after evidence collection.
- Verify recovery by confirming no active record nodes in PipeWire/PulseAudio and no further opens on /dev/snd/*, and restart affected user sessions or hosts if audio subsystem settings were altered.
- Harden by restricting access to /dev/snd/* via udev group membership and AppArmor/SELinux, whitelisting approved desktop apps, and adding detections to flag non-interactive parents launching arecord/ffmpeg or pw-cat -r and creation of large audio files in cache/temp paths.
- Escalate to incident response and privacy/legal if recording is initiated by a root-owned systemd service or an unknown binary in /tmp, or if audio streaming/exfiltration to external IPs/domains is observed.
