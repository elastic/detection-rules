### Investigating Potential Execution via SSH Backdoor

Linux SSH backdoors, such as the XZBackdoor, leverage SSH, a secure protocol for remote access, to execute malicious commands stealthily. Adversaries exploit SSH by initiating sessions that mimic legitimate activity, then abruptly terminate them post-execution to evade detection. The detection rule identifies anomalies by tracking SSH processes that start and end unexpectedly, especially when non-standard executables are invoked, signaling potential backdoor activity.

### Possible investigation steps

- Review the SSH session logs on the affected host to identify any unusual or unauthorized access attempts, focusing on sessions that match the process.pid and process.entity_id from the alert.
- Examine the command history and executed commands for the user associated with the user.id in the alert to identify any suspicious or unexpected activities.
- Investigate the non-standard executables invoked by the SSH session by checking the process.executable field to determine if they are legitimate or potentially malicious.
- Analyze the network activity associated with the SSH session, particularly any disconnect_received events, to identify any unusual patterns or connections to suspicious IP addresses.
- Check the exit codes of the SSH processes, especially those with a non-zero process.exit_code, to understand the reason for the abrupt termination and whether it aligns with typical error codes or indicates malicious activity.

### False positive analysis

- Legitimate administrative SSH sessions may trigger the rule if they involve non-standard executables. To manage this, create exceptions for known administrative scripts or tools that are frequently used in your environment.
- Automated processes or scripts that use SSH for routine tasks might mimic the behavior of the XZBackdoor. Identify these processes and exclude them by specifying their executable paths or command-line patterns in the rule exceptions.
- Security tools or monitoring solutions that perform SSH-based checks could be mistaken for malicious activity. Review these tools and add their signatures to the exclusion list to prevent false alerts.
- Custom applications that use SSH for communication might be flagged. Document these applications and adjust the rule to recognize their specific execution patterns as non-threatening.
- Temporary network issues causing abrupt SSH session terminations could be misinterpreted as suspicious behavior. Monitor network stability and consider excluding known transient disconnections from triggering alerts.

### Response and remediation

- Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement.
- Terminate any suspicious SSH sessions identified by the detection rule to stop ongoing malicious activity.
- Conduct a thorough review of the affected host's SSH configuration and logs to identify unauthorized changes or access patterns.
- Reset credentials for any user accounts involved in the suspicious SSH activity to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Restore the affected system from a known good backup if any unauthorized changes or malware are detected.
- Implement network segmentation to limit SSH access to critical systems and reduce the attack surface.
- Escalate the incident to the security operations center (SOC) for further investigation and to determine if additional systems are compromised."""
