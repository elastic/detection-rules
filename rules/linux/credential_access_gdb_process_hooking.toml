This rule monitors for potential memory dumping through gdb. Attackers may leverage memory dumping techniques to attempt
secret extraction from privileged processes. Tools that display this behavior include "truffleproc" and
"bash-memory-dump". This behavior should not happen by default, and should be investigated thoroughly.
