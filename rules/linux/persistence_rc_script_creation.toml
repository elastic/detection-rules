description = """
This rule monitors the creation/alteration of the rc.local file by a previously unknown process executable
through the use of the new terms rule type. The /etc/rc.local file is used to start custom applications,
services, scripts or commands during start-up. The rc.local file has mostly been replaced by Systemd.
However, through the "systemd-rc-local-generator", rc.local files can be converted to services that run at 
boot. Adversaries may alter rc.local to execute malicious code at start-up, and gain persistence onto the 
system.
