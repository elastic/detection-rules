Identifies the creation of a symbolic link to a suspicious file or location. A symbolic link is a reference to a file or
directory that acts as a pointer or shortcut, allowing users to access the target file or directory from a different
location in the file system. An attacker can potentially leverage symbolic links for privilege escalation by tricking a
privileged process into following the symbolic link to a sensitive file, giving the attacker access to data or
capabilities they would not normally have.
