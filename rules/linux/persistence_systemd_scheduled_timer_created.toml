Detects the creation of a systemd timer within any of the default systemd timer directories. Systemd timers can be used 
by an attacker to gain persistence, by scheduling the execution of a command or script. Similarly to cron/at, systemd 
timers can be set up to execute on boot time, or on a specific point in time, which allows attackers to regain access in 
case the connection to the infected asset was lost.
