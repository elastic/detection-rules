## Enhancement - Guidelines

These guidelines serve as a reminder set of considerations when addressing adding a feature to the code.

### Documentation and Context

- [ ] Describe the feature enhancement in detail (alternative solutions, description of the solution, etc.) if not already documented in an issue.
- [ ] Include additional context or screenshots.
- [ ] Ensure the enhancement includes necessary updates to the documentation and versioning.

### Code Standards and Practices

- [ ] Code follows established design patterns within the repo and avoids duplication.
- [ ] Ensure that the code is modular and reusable where applicable.

### Testing

- [ ] New unit tests have been added to cover the enhancement.
- [ ] Existing unit tests have been updated to reflect the changes.
- [ ] Provide evidence of testing and validating the enhancement (e.g., test logs, screenshots).
- [ ] Validate that any rules affected by the enhancement are correctly updated.
- [ ] Ensure that performance is not negatively impacted by the changes.
- [ ] Verify that any release artifacts are properly generated and tested.
- [ ] Conducted system testing, including fleet, import, and create APIs (e.g., run `make test-cli`, `make test-remote-cli`, `make test-hunting-cli`)

### Additional Checks

- [ ] Verify that the enhancement works across all relevant environments (e.g., different OS versions).
- [ ] Confirm that the proper version label is applied to the PR `patch`, `minor`, `major`.
