# OOB Fleet integration release

### Release branch
<!-- this will dictate which stacks get the updates (>= up to major)
        the title should reflect this version; ex: releasing from 8.0 is 1.0.x
        the patch version represents the iteration of the release, so the 3rd release for 8.0 is 1.0.3
